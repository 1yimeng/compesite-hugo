### Christmas in September


An interesting way to end the "summer", we've apparently broken some records for the coldest September in a long time.  Of course, we should be used to that by now in Edmonton, and we won't let a little bit (or a lot) of snow stop us.  So here is a run down of some highlights for the coming week!

### Highlights
*  New Stock: Check out the CompE club room for snacks and other essentials
*  CompE Club Boardgames Night: You won't be BOARD at this event üòÇ
*  Industry Info Session: Meet employers from Arista Networks
*  Careers Day 2018: UofA's biggest career event
*  Acing the Interview: Session to improve your interview skils!
*  Resume / Cover Letter Peer Review
