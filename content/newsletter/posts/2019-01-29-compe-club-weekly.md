Do you ever feel like you have no idea what you are doing?
You could be reading a job posting and seeing all the things that you don’t seem to be qualified for, or prepping for an interview and worrying about all the questions they could ask that you don’t know. Maybe you’re at an internship or starting a new job and feel like everyone else seems to “know what to do” but you have no idea where to begin. And suddenly you start questioning yourself - do I belong here, do I deserve this opportunity?

Did you know you’re not alone in feeling this way? Come out to our next Jobber JUMP event on Wednesday, February 13th to hear a presentation and panel all about keeping yourself in the race: not disqualifying yourself when reading through a job posting, how to interview with confidence - even with limited experience, and how to fight through Imposter Syndrome as you jump from curriculum into your career!

You’ll get to hang out with fellow students from many campuses, eat some pizza, and meet some members of our Jobber team!
