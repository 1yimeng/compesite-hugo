### 3) ESS' Next Level talk: Unorthodox Engineers



**WHO:** Students and Alumni interested in applying their learning in non-engineering fields
**WHEN:** Thursday, November 22 @ 5:30pm to 7:00pm
**WHERE:** 8-207, Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering
**WHAT:**

Getting an engineering degree is a great way to hone skills and attributes that can be applied in various occupations. It is no surprise a good percentage of engineering graduates will end up in a field that is nothing like what they studied for. Are you one of those engineers thinking you may put your iron ring to work in a non-engineering venture? Maybe you are sure engineering is your main love but you plan to lend the skills you have obtained to other side passions upon graduation. Come join us and some engineering graduates who took the path less traveled in our second Next Level Talks of the semester.
Come learn the what, why, and how straight from some Unorthodox Engineers.

As is the custom with all our events, this session is free to attend, FOOD WILL BE PROVIDED

Join Amii as we pull back the curtain on AI and lay a pragmatic foundation for what AI is, what it isn't, and how you can begin to think about the place of AI in your business.
