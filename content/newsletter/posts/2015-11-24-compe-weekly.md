### The 12th Annual
Engineering Head Shave


</br>

### Thursday, November 26th


The ESS will be hosting its annual Engineering Head Shave this Thursday to raise money for the Alberta Cancer Foundation. This year, we are hoping to raise $15,000 to continue to help Albertan families facing cancer. You can show your support by donating online or at the GEER store. If you are interested in being a part of the head shave, you can also register online and set up a personal fundraising page.

Our very own VP Internal Derek Shultz will be shaving his head on Thursday so be sure to dontate for the great cause! Check out the website [here. ](http://albertacancer.ca/enggshave)

### FIRST LEGO League
Volunteer Opportunity


FIRST® LEGO® League is recruiting volunteers for its 2016 FLL Tournament. FLL introduces children ages 9-14 to the fun and excitement of science and technology. These inspired young minds will go head to head in a high level competition demonstrating what their hi-tech Lego engineered robots can do as they try to complete this year's challenges.

The FLL Tournament is a Lego Mindstorms competition where students from schools across Alberta complete a series of table-top challenges, make a group presentation about the sustainability-related topic of the year, and have fun! FLL is always looking for volunteers to help run and set up the event. On Tournament Day (early January), FLL is always in need of Technical Judges, Presentation &Teamwork Judges, and helping hands in general. Volunteering on Tournament Day only takes up a Friday evening (training/setup) and a Saturday and is a great way to give back to the community and get kids excited about technology!

For more information on FLL, visit the website (http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) . Interested in volunteering? http://www.firstalberta.org/volunteer/
