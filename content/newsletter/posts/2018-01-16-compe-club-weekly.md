### 2. HackED 2018

**When:** Saturday, Jan. 27, 12pm - Sunday, Jan. 28, 12pm
**Where:** Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering

Hackathons are for designing, creating, and building awesome projects. HackED is the premiere, annual, 24-hour hackathon from the Computer Engineering Club of the University of Alberta.

This event is for hackers who choose to learn because they can, and build because they love it. We’re about working together and applying yourself, your skills and your creativity.

Join us over the weekend of January 27 to hack your way to something new. Bring on the challenge, bring your ideas to life.

For more information and to register, click here (http://hacked2018.hackerearth.com/) .

This event takes a lot of work to run. If you want to help give back to this event, please consider volunteering to help run the event (general running of stations, set up, tear down, etc.). Sign up for volunteers is here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee-wsEI1K-nBiu0OZoa8EKCQFPjpmdjsfDzGvrqOs08fe1hg/viewform?usp=sf_link) .
