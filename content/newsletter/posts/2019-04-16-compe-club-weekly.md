This will be the last CompE Weekly of the semester. Thanks to all those who have read these every week and we hope you enjoy a slightly less cluttered inbox over the summer. To those of you who are graduating, we hope you have a successful career ahead of you. To those of you who are still making your way through your degree, we hope to see you next Fall. Sentiments aside, there are still events to plug, and we are going to plug them!

### 5)  Horizons School of Technology: Fellowship Opportunity


**WHO:** Anyone interested in furthering their CS Education
**WHERE:**  Apply Here (http://www.joinhorizons.com/fellowship?email=president@compeclub.com&school=University+of+Alberta&club=Computer+Engineering+Club&campaign=club)
**WHAT:**  The Horizons Fellowship is a fully-funded technology immersion fellowship for top university students from around the world. As technology continues to play a larger role on the world stage, whether it be in business, politics, art, etc., we have been reaching out to various University of Alberta clubs to encourage students to gain a solid technical foundation.

Past Horizonites have come from schools like Harvard, Princeton, UPenn/Wharton, Columbia, and more. We've had engineers, business students, liberal arts majors and designers take our program - they've gone on to receive product management, engineering, and venture capital offers from firms such as Google, Zappos.com, Yelp, Optimizely, Redfin, Insight Venture Partners, and Slack. Others are winning global hackathons and building their own startup ideas.

Interested students can start an application here!

### 6) NSERC: Become a Student Ambassador!



**WHO:** Anyone passionate about STEM
**WHEN:** There is no deadline, details in the link below
**WHERE:** HERE! (http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/Ambassadors-Ambassadeurs_eng.asp)
**WHAT:** Want to build a stronger science culture in Canada?
If so, then apply now for an NSERC Student Ambassador grant – worth $1,000. The grant provided Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, or NSERC, will cover the expenses involved in sharing your enthusiasm for STEM.

To apply, you must be a student over 16 years old, enrolled in a Canadian university, polytechnic, college, or Cégep in the natural sciences and engineering. The grant will help you deliver an outreach activity to promote science and engineering to youth who are under-represented in STEM.
If this opportunity interests you, consider planning your activity to coincide with Science Odyssey, the NSERC-led cross-Canada STEM celebration held in May each year. Science Odyssey will add national visibility to your outreach activity and you will be part of the biggest and best known STEM event in Canada!

### 7) Student Career Interests Survey: Your Opinion Matters!


**WHO:** Anyone who has opinions!
**WHEN:** NOW!
**WHERE:** HERE (http://www.brainstormresearch.ca/survey)
**WHAT:** The Engineering Employment Centre is pleased to be participating in a national research study of student interests and attitudes regarding their careers and employers.  The resulting report will help employers better understand how to attract and hire students and graduates while also helping us learn how to better serve you with career planning support.
All respondents to the survey are eligible to enter a draw for a $500 Best Buy Gift Card, and all responses will be treated as confidential and not be associated with your identity in any way.
As an Engineering student at the University of Alberta, you have access to the services offered by both the Engineering Employment Centre (in ETLC) as well as the U of A Career Centre (in SUB).  Please be aware of this distinction if you are providing written responses to questions about the career services you have accessed.
