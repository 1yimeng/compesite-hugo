Happening this week, there are Tech Talks from various companies, tabling from the clubs, and a student-industry mixer. Whether you are a first year looking to get into ECE, or are already in your discipline and are looking to sit back and have a beer with Engineers from industry, learn about cool stuff happening in industry, or find a job, ECE Week is for you!

Tuesday Night - EE Tech Talks
Wednesday Night - EngPhys Tech Talks
Thursday Night - CompE Tech Talks
Friday Night - Student / Industry Mixer

RSVP (it's free!) on the ECE Week website here: <https://eceweek.compeclub.com>, and be sure to bring your resume to the industry mixer on Friday!

### 2. HackED

Jan 31st - Feb 1st
Have an idea for an app, embedded system, or other doohickey? The second annual CompE hackathon is coming at the end of January. With over $2000 in prizes, industry reps looking to hire top talent, and 24 hours of fun, HackED is the best place to build your awesome ideas, and get noticed by recruiters (nevermind win cool stuff!)

Getting started is simple: register yourself right away at <https://hackathon.compeclub.com>, and start brainstorming. Then on January 31st, code, tinker, and hack your way to first place in groups of up to three members!

Lastly, a shout-out to our amazing sponsors: (and did we mention that they're hiring?)

The Computer Engineering Club is holding their Winter AGM in February this year.
