[QUIZ ](http://quiz.pandarose.ca/programming)

Hello as promised we have gotten a professional, Dr ReCompile, to write an column for our article. He will be answering your questions sent in, on the newsletter. So if you have any questions email [advice@compeclub.com](mailto:advice@compeclub.com)  and he will get back to you. Now on to our first question.


Hello Dr. Recompile,

I have heard about Two's Complement but I don't know what it is about and I am kinda worried?

-A worried second year


Hello worried second year student,

Don't worry any longer I, Dr. Recompile can help you. Two's Complement is a binary format used to represent signed integers.

To know the sign of a Two's Complement number look at the most significant bit if it is zero then it is positive it is one then it is negative. The magnitude of a positive Two's Complement number can be easily found, it is represented in the rest of the number in a regular binary format. To get the magnitude of a negative number note the least significant bit and invert the rest of the number, the magnitude is now in a regular binary format.

Now if you don't understand don't worry you will be covering it at least three times in the next two years.

Sincerely,

Dr. Recompile
