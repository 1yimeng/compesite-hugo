### 3. Startup Edmonton Democamp 34

**When:** Tuesday, January 24 at 6:30 pm
**Where:** CCIS 1-140, University of Alberta

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

Drinks and networking to follow at RATT (Room At The Top) - 7th floor of the Students Union Building

As part of ECE week, please read below, feel free to share with other students in Engineering.
The Faculty of Engineering partnered with the Alberta School of Business present the Cheriton Distinguished Lecture Series featuring Hemi Thaker.

Hemi is a University of Alberta alum, graduating from the Computer Engineering program in '86, and a very successful business entrepreneur. He earned his Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo and has launched two winning companies with very little start-up money. As the winner of the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award he hopes to inspire Canadians to take risks in their careers. He has had successes and what he calls successful failures over the years and with his vast life experience this proves to be a stimulating lecture for both Engineers and business enthusiasts.

### 5. Weekly Coding Event Interest Survey


We are trying to coordinate social coding events for Comp E starting this year. We're sending out a survey to gauge interest.

The plan is to book a room on a weekly basis where people can go to work on personal projects and get mentorship from later year students. Also we wanted to eventually have people do small guided sessions where they do a tutorial on a language/library/project that they know or are working on.

Please fill out this [survey ](https://compeclub1.typeform.com/to/lneGSx) to provide feedback for this idea if you'd like to see this happen.

### 9. DiscoverE Girls Coding Club: Female Volunteers Needed

Girls Coding Club and GEM (Girls Engineering and Mentorship) are day camps run on Saturdays throughout the semester for young girls in grade 3 to 5 and 6 to 9.

These camps help to promote the sciences to young girls and of course to work these clubs volunteers are needed! Specifically female volunteers to show just how cool and possible it is to be Girl in the sciences!

The time commitment is either just your Saturday morning or afternoon, once a week from January to April. It's a great way to inspire the next generation and build up your resume with volunteer work!

### 10. Volunteer Opportunity: CHOICES Conference 2017

Greetings from WISEST!

We would like to invite you to consider volunteering for WISEST's upcoming CHOICES Conference for Grade 6 girls, scheduled to take place over Reading Week on February 21 & 22, 2017.

Our CHOICES Conference will bring 300 girls to the U of A on both Feb. 21 & 22 (for a total of 600 students!). Our goal is to get these young women excited about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through hands-on, fun, and engaging activities.  These activities would not be possible without the tremendous support that we receive from our volunteers.

We are currently looking for individuals to fill the following roles:

Science Activity Leaders -  Undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, lab coordinators, and professionals can all volunteer to lead or assist with a lab activity related to their field of interest.  We generally ask volunteers to commit to delivering their activity twice on each day of the conference but can possibly take volunteers who can only commit to one day. We are open to hearing your ideas for new activities or can suggest some tried and tested activities from previous CHOICES Conferences!

[SIGN UP HERE! ](https://goo.gl/forms/wjUgbZ8Mg98CmPpx2)

Campus Ambassadors and General Volunteers - Undergraduates, graduate or PhD students, and high school students are all welcome to consider either of these volunteer roles. Campus Ambassadors help to guide students around campus while General Volunteers assist with event logistics like set up, registration, signage, clean up, etc.

[SIGN UP HERE!  ](https://goo.gl/forms/4gaJvsDIY0Qkl07h1)

### 12. LEED Green Associate Training

**When:** March 4^th 2017 – 12:00PM to 5:00 PM
**Where:** University of Alberta – ECHA – Room 1-182 - https://goo.gl/maps/uT5Lh
Registration: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/

Interested in getting involved in the Green Building and sustainability Industry? Opportunities are plentiful and passing your LEED professional designation is required to get involved!

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a green-rating point system to certify a building’s sustainability. Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, students and professional can become LEED Accredited themselves.  The LEED Green Associate (GA) credential is the only professional designation used to market yourself to employers and clients and show you have certified knowledge in the green building industry.

To date, this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping over 7000 students pass their exam at a 100% pass rate and does not require any specific background. This course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their name and it never expires!

Also, a new LEED rating system (v4) was introduced this year and this training course is one of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system to ensure your knowledge is up to date! This course meets the exam’s eligibility requirements and the USGBC charges a $100 (reduced for students) fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time at your nearest Prometric center.

Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)
To register for the class please visit: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/
You can register via PayPal or RSVP your attendance by registering at the bottom of the page
