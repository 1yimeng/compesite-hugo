WISEST SET Conference
Saturday, November 7th, 2015

The SET (Science, Engineering, and Technology) Conference hosted by WISEST is a fun day that will show grades 10-12 high school girls the diverse career options in science, engineering, and technology. This full-day conference (with lunch included) allows participants to experience real lab environments through hands-on lab activities. This year it will be held on Saturday, November 7th, 2015.

If you are interested in strengthening science and society through diversity, and providing opportunity to our SET students, there are several volunteer opportunities available for the SET Conference.
For more information and the positions available, click [here](http://www.mailoutinteractive.com/Industry/View.aspx?id=712563&q=917448128&qz=f5b013) .
B-Squared Opportunity

The organization BSquared is developing a website to connect the university together.  Their featured map for the U of A, can zoom into as close as far as desks within the library. People doing study groups, may describe their table as open/private and also what subject matter they are studying to invite or not invite people to join them. The website is 80% developed but they are looking for computing science students to help them finish up and maintain it. They are offering limited equity for 3 students.

For more information contact: <runjia@ualberta.ca>
