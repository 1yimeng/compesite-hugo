### 2. DEMOCAMP 37

**When:** Wednesday, September 27, 2017 @ 6:30pm - 8:30pm
**Where:** CCIS L1-160

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

### 3. WISER/UA-WiSE present: Mentorship Program 2017-2018

UA-WiSE (University of Alberta Women in Science and Engineering) and WISER (Women in Science Engineering and Research) are launching the third year of their mentorship program. The program is geared towards STEM fields and aims to connect undergraduate students, early career professionals, graduate students, and professionals who are well established in their careers. The program is open to both men and women.

Each group consists of a mentor who is well established in their field, a graduate student or early career professional mentee, and an undergraduate student mentee. Trio matching will be done by the Mentorship Organizing Committee based on the participants’ future goals and areas of expertise.

The program will run from October 2017 until March 2018 and will include three formal events:
* October 5, 2017: Launch Event to introduce the trios and provide training for the program.
* January 25, 2018: Professional Panel Discussion where participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and dialogue with experienced professionals in academia, industry and government.
* March 27, 2018: Professional development workshop (topic will be chosen according to participant feedback).

Interested participants are asked to kindly complete the application (https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ua-wisewiser-mentorship-questionnaire-tickets-36866842719)  by September 19, 2017 (TODAY).

Program Benefits for Mentors:
* Networking with other mentors at the three program events

* Extending your network  with early career professionals
* Improving your communication and leadership skills

We are a student group that is dedicated to the yearly robotic competition “Robomasters", where 5 robots that are designed and built from each team will fight to the death in an arena twice as big as a basketball court. You have probably seen us showcasing our robots at the beginning of your classes, as well as at ETLC Atrium.

In this info session, we will go through what our Electrical, Mechanical and Comp Science/Comp Engineering team do in technical detail. If you like robotics and wants to be part of its design, come check us out!
