### 6. Communitech's Code/Design to Win


**When:**  24th of October from 5-7pm
**Where:** ETLC E2-001 and E2-002

Want to make $5000 in one day, legally?
Come show off your skills at Code/Design to Win! It’s exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards.

But seriously, what is it
Code/Design to Win is a good old fashioned skills competition. If you’re a student who loves computer science, programming background or design (UX/UI) and attend one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you.

How does one apply?
First, you’ll have to write the preliminary exam (don’t worry, you got this) on October 24th. The top students will be invited to the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Region on January 21, 2017 to participate in the finals, meet with some really great companies, and have your shot at taking home $5,000!

Am I eligible to win the moneys?
