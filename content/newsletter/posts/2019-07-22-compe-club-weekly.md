### CompE Announcement


**WHO:** Anyone feeling entrepreneurial
**WHEN:**  ASAP
**WHERE:** Here
**WHAT:** Are you interested in startup culture? Do you want to break into the startup field? Skylor J. Lane is looking to create a program to help innovative individuals realize their ideas. The program offers students a subsidized living space with like-minded peers. The goal is to enable students to get the help they need to get their ideas off the ground, similar to the Velocity residence in Waterloo. Priority will be given to those with technical skills, but all that is required to apply is a burning passion for startups. There is currently room for 7 people in this program. If you're interested, you should apply while you can.

Email skylor@ualberta.ca (mailto:skylor@ualberta.ca) to apply.
