### Be a part of world-class research this summer


</br>

### Learn about quantum information processing and gain research experience


At the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) we have a couple of different learning opportunities available for undergraduate students interested in quantum information processing.

Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) - May 29-June 9
Start the summer with a [two-week introduction](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=6e28c420bd&e=5ed82361f6)  to the theoretical and experimental study of quantum information processing which includes 30 hours in the labs. You will get the opportunity to interact with students from around world, work with graduate students, postdocs and IQC faculty. This program is fully funded – including your accommodations and food. You can also apply for travel bursaries.
[Watch this quick video ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=75a29bbb7c&e=5ed82361f6)  to get a feel for the full experience.

Undergraduate Research Award - all summer
Join us at IQC for the summer through an[ Undergraduate Research Award ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=cd0f606897&e=5ed82361f6)  and work with one of our researchers – experimentalist or theorist. Not only will you enhance your research experience and prepare for your graduate studies and research career, but you get the chance to attend IQC seminars, lectures, and student talks. This is a unique opportunity to interact with an interdisciplinary research community.

Apply before January 9!
You can choose to only apply to attend USEQIP, to only apply for an Undergraduate Research Award, or apply for both.
* If you want to apply to both, complete the[ USEQIP application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=b53471c1ff&e=5ed82361f6)  and check the appropriate box for the Undergraduate Research Award.*
* If you only want to apply for USEQIP, complete the[ USEQIP application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=d1ced32c7e&e=5ed82361f6)  but do NOT check the box for the Undergraduate Research Award.
