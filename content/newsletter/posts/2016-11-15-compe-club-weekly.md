### 3. UA-WISE Fall Coffee Night

**When:** Thursday, November 24, 2016 from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm
**Where:** ECHA 1-430

You are invited to UA-WISE's brand new event, Fall Coffee Night, which is an opportunity for students to engage and network with professionals from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Enjoy the opportunity to learn tips and tricks on how to gain work or research experience from professionals themselves.

Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the chance to talk one on one with recruiters and hiring managers on what they are looking for when hiring new grads or current undergraduate students. We hope that this event can lead to future possibilities for students, or at least offer direction on how to obtain those possibilities.

Please come out to the event ready to talk to professionals with questions and topics you would discuss with them!

Undergraduate Research Award - all summer
Join us at IQC for the summer through an[ Undergraduate Research Award](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=cd0f606897&e=5ed82361f6)  and work with one of our researchers – experimentalist or theorist. Not only will you enhance your research experience and prepare for your graduate studies and research career, but you get the chance to attend IQC seminars, lectures, and student talks. This is a unique opportunity to interact with an interdisciplinary research community.

Apply before January 9!
You can choose to only apply to attend USEQIP, to only apply for an Undergraduate Research Award, or apply for both.
* If you want to apply to both, complete the[ USEQIP application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=b53471c1ff&e=5ed82361f6)  and check the appropriate box for the Undergraduate Research Award.*
* If you only want to apply for USEQIP, complete the [USEQIP application](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=d1ced32c7e&e=5ed82361f6)  but do NOT check the box for the Undergraduate Research Award.
* If you only want to apply for the Undergraduate Research Award, [complete the URA application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=19af1d9716&e=5ed82361f6) .
