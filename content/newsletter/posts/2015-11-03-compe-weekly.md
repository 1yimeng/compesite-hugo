### Microsoft Information Session

Thursday, November 5th, 5-8pm
CCIS L1-140
A paper resume is great, but since your next employer is going to look you up online, you’ll want to make sure your online profile is as professional as your paper one. The solution: an online resume!

Get your resume up and running in around an hour with the help of a Microsoft specialist. You’ll start with the technical know-how: how to quickly set up a website to host your online resume or portfolio for free using Microsoft Azure. Second, see how to ace the content: get tips and best practices from Microsoft recruiters and managers so you can create a great online resume that really stands out.

Be sure to bring your laptop and have a [Microsoft Account](https://login.live.com/ppsecure/secure.srf?lc=1033&sf=1&id=38936&ru=https://account.live.com/&tw=0&fs=0&kv=0&cb=&cbcxt=&wp=SAPI&wa=wsignin1.0&wreply=https://account.live.com/)  (Outlook, Hotmail, or Live) to get free access to the tools you’ll need to start building your online resume in this interactive workshop.

Lastly, they will also be accepting paper resumes at the end of the event from technical students interested in intern and full-time positions at Microsoft.
