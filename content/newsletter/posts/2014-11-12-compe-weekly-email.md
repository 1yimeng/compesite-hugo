### 2. ECE Night

The ECE Department is holding an ECE Night on November 18th in the Solarium from 5-7. There will be pizza, pop and door prizes for those in attendance. This is an opportunity for first year students to see what the ECE Department has to offer much earlier in the year than at first year night. There will be students and Faculty speaking and plenty of time for all your questions to be answered!

### 6. Grilled Cheese and Bacon??

Normally, we wouldn't randomly advertise some event that we overheard was happening on the other side of campus, but in this case, we think that it is in the interests of all of our readers that this is shared:

On Thursday, November 13, the [Student Design Association](http://www.thesda.ca/) will be selling grilled cheese sandwiches in Fine Arts Building. And they'll have bacon too. Yes, bacon. This is a fundraiser to help raise money for a Design Pop Up Show they are hosting in Enterprise Square in the month of December

Be sure to take advantage of this if you find yourself around HUB on Thursday!
