Every year, UARM participates in two of the biggest international robotic competitions -- IEEE ICRA A. I Challenge and RoboMaster University Championship. Students will independently design and manufacture 7 robots choosing from 5 different types: aerial, hero, sentry, engineer and standard. Participants can apply classroom knowledge to real-world problems filled with nonidealities. If you wish to learn more about computer vision, machine learning, microcontroller programming, or mechanical design, this is the perfect place! If you have little or no experience but still want to participate, we will be hosting tutorial sessions for those who are less experienced to catch you up with the relevant knowledge and know-how for our projects.
