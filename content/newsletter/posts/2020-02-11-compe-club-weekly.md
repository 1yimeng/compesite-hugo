The Schulich Foundation invites you to tackle this problem with AI. Groups of up to 5 people are tasked with creating an AI that can evaluate the validity of the statement, and if possible, provide evidence. The winning team will claim the $1 milllion prize! This is a great experience to undertake. The competition is far off now, but it definatly worth your consideration!
