**WHAT:** 

ECE First Year night is coming. If you're in your first year
and you're having doubts about what discipline to pick, this is the event for you!
If you're not in the first year, be sure to let all your first-year friends know.
This will be an hour-long panel where panelists will
discuss what one can expect from each ECE discipline.
Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions about what it's like
being in one of the top 3 Engineering disciplines. Everything from course content
to career advice, with sessions for 1 on 1 Q&A if you're so inclined.
We hope to see you there.
