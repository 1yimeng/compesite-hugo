### Back for more?


It's a new semester, and the newsletter is back to its regular weekly schedule! We hope that your summer was a relaxing break from campus. If you were taking classes during the Spring / Summer terms... well at least you should be in the right mindset already üòõ.

The first couple weeks of a new semester are always some of the best, classes are still fresh and interesting, midterms are way off in the horizon, and there is a ton of events and free food all over the university.  Kicking off this year we have a bunch of exciting announcements and events (and food!) for you to take advantage of.
