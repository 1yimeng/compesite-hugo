### Scope AR Opportunity


Scope AR is focused on bridging the gap between the most advanced computer vision technologies and the best wearable and mobile hardware devices to provide industries with useful AR solutions. They provide solutions to aerospace, energy, automotive, medical, manufacturing, etc. Their goal is to simplify knowledge transfer in a way that enables corporations to distribute their current best practices to their entire workforce.

Scope AR currently branches to two products. The first is Remote AR, an augmented reality tele-presence tool that connects field technicians with remote experts to assist with real-time problem solving. The second is an authoring platform that allows companies to create augmented step-by-step instruction to assist with training and on-the-job maintenance.

Scope AR is looking to hire a junior software developer. They are looking for current students or recent graduates of their Computing Science degree. The position requires a self-motivated individual to take ownership of tasks and projects that they are appointed.
