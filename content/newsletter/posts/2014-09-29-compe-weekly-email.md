### 5. DemoCamp

DemoCamp is an event that brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with 200-300 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

See full event details at http://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/events/206914442/. Hashtag is #democampyeg

Date: Monday, September 29th
Time: 6:30 pm doors open, 6:45 pm program starts
Location: ETLC E1-013, University of Alberta
