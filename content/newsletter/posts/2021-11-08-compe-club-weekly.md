**WHAT:** HackED Beta is an introductory 24-hour coding competition that is put on by the Computer Engineering Club each year! This year it is being held virtually between 12:00 noon on Saturday, November 13th and 5:00 pm Sunday, November 14th! The goal of the hackathon is for teams of up to six people to work together to make incredible hardware or software projects over the 24-hour hacking period! Then teams will have the opportunity to present their finished projects to a panel of industry judges for the chance to win awesome prizes! 

Note: This is the CompE Club's introductory hackathon for the year, so only those who have attended at most one other hackathon are eligible to participate. As well there is no prior coding knowledge required, so anyone who is interested in working on cool projects can join! We will also be running various workshops throughout the event to help participants learn new things and hone their skills!
