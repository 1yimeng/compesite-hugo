### 3) CanGro: A Sustainability Project Group

**WHO:** Anyone interested sustainability and agriculture
**WHERE:** [Contact Michael Kellough](kellough@ualberta.ca)
**WHAT:**  CanGro is a new student project group focusing on making sustainable agriculture through hydroponics. These farms take significantly less water and space than traditional farms. CanGro aims to create an integrated modular farm capable of growing food throughout the year. This food could then be given to the university, or donated to the food bank. The group plans to design the farm over the next 4 months, and build the farm in the fall semester. The group needs individuals of all backgrounds to design this farm. Computer Engineering students are needed to design the climate control system and software to interface with it. If this initiative appeals to you, we encourage you to contact Michael Kellough <kellough@ualberta.ca>.

**WHERE:** [Here](https://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com/en/)
**WHAT:**  Misinformation is rampant no matter where you look on the internet.

The Schulich Foundation invites you to tackle this problem with AI. Groups of up to 5 people are tasked with creating an AI that can evaluate the validity of the statement, and if possible, provide evidence. The winning team will claim the $1 milllion prize! This is a great experience to undertake. The competition is far off now, but it definatly worth your consideration!
