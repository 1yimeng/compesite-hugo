### 2. Tec Edmonton Speaker Series


**When:** 5:00-6:30pm Thursday, April 6
**Where:** ETLC E2-2

The TEC Edmonton speaker series will largely focus on fostering entrepreneurship, and touch on technology commercialization, company startups, venture financing and market strategy!

Find more information here (https://www.facebook.com/events/405726383136984/) .

</br>

### 3. Final 469


**When:** April 6th, 5:00PM till whenever you either pass out or decide to go home
**Where:** RATT (Room at the Top)

This is it! The last week of classes for CMPUT 469! Everyone better come out and attend the final! That way we can take over RATT and show everyone how Comp Sci/Comp E students aren't as shut in as people think we are.

469 often sees the visit of a lot of alumni so it's also a great time to get to know some people who are in the field and have experience in the working world!

Come on out this Thursday!

</br>

### 4. Hearthstone Tournament


**When:** April 8, 2pm - 6pm
**Where:** WEM Microsoft Store

They are back at it again with the Hearthstone tournaments! Once more, The WEM Microsoft store will be hosting another Hearthstone Tournament.

It will be scheduled for April 8th, starting at 2, and running until 6. Like last time, they will be providing everyone with a device pre-loaded with Hearthstone, and will be offering snacks and drinks to all attendees.

A few quick points:
1. The game mode will be STANDARD, no wild decks allowed.
2. Make sure you have 3 decks ready to go. It will be best of 3, so you might not use all 3 each round, but having options is always good.
3. MAKE SURE YOU LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET (http://battle.net/)   TO YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT. They almost had to cancel an Overwatch tournament since Battle.net (http://battle.net/)  was having security/server issues. The easiest workaround was linking Battle.net (http://battle.net/)  to Facebook to ensure you can log in no problem!
4. There will be more computers provided than last time, meaning it should be possible to have a losers' bracket this time around, as long as you control players don't take 30 min per game ;)
5. Have fun. They host these events so that you, the community, can come and enjoy yourselves, meet new friends, and just have a rocking time.

Any questions or concerns, email sasorous@microsoft.com (mailto:sasorous@microsoft.com)

### 5. Ada's Team Presents: A Journey Through Types by Calvin Beck


**When:** Monday, April 10th 5pm-7pm
**Where:** CSC B-41 (basement of CSC in one of the tiny rooms)

A talk about the wonderful world of types and programming languages,with a dash of formal verification. Does your  programming language get you down? It probably should! Ever wish you could prove that your program was correct? Maybe you can! Join us as we briefly explore some alternatives with typed functional programming languages. With a bit of luck you will catch a glimpse into how programming languages can make your lives easier, and the world a better and safer place. Types aren't the Java-esk horrors of your nightmares, instead they can make programming a pure delight! Let's discover why that annoying person keeps talking about Haskell, and why that even more obnoxious person won't shut up about Idris.

</br>

### 6. LAN Party


**When:** April 13 - 14, 12pm - 12pm (24 hour event!)
**Where:** CSC Building, main floor

Comp Sci has a tradition of holding a LAN party at the end of the semester and it's about that time of year again! This year it shall be on April 13th-14th (Thursday - Friday). (It's on the weekdays due to the Easter weekend.) The year-end LAN party is always a fun time and is a great time to relax after completing the semester before exams start up.

They are asking if anyone has any game requests. If you have a good one that you would like to see at the party, please email vpjuniorrep@uacs.ca (mailto:vpjuniorrep@uacs.ca) .

### 8. GCTools Hackathon

The GCTools is the suite of applications for digital collaboration between departments of the Government of Canada (GC). The main tools are GCpedia (based on MediaWiki) and GCconnex (based on Elgg). GCconnex is the internal GC social network. GCcollab was recently put online for collaboration between the federal and provincial / territorial civil service and Canadian colleges / universities. GCcollab is a platform for collaboration with members of the public service (and other organizations) and also to find employment opportunities.  Teachers and students can register here (http://consultations.tbs-sct.gc.ca/s/gctools-reg-ins-outilsgc/?l=en) .
https://gccollab.ca/

All code and development is available on Github. This is the code that will be used for the hackathon. Most of the activity is on GCconnex, but all changes are being integrated into GCcollab and vice versa.
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gccollab
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcconnex
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcpedia

The GCTools Hackathon will be on April 6-7, 2017 at the Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Service Lab in Ottawa.  You can participate virtually.  The goal is that diverse teams participate in improving the GCTools. There will be already identified issues and tasks as well as the possibility of proposing new functionality. In addition, the following challenges were identified as areas where we want to improve the GCTools::
* Accessibility
* User friendliness and experience
* Collaboration with open source software communities

The website can be found here (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/campaigns/gctools-hackathon.html) .

Also, a virtual workshop will be held on March 22, 2017 at 1 p.m. EST. to give participants an overview of the GCTools and a chance to ask questions, such as:
* What is the hackathon all about?
* What are the GCTools?
+ GCconnex, GCpedia, Gccollab, etc.
* What is open source software?
* What open source software is used in the Government of Canada?
* Next Steps

### 10. Masters/PhD in Montreal


Dr. Giovanni Beltrame, from MIST Lab at Ecole Polytechnique, is really aiming to get some more Canadian Masters and PhD students on his Robotics research team (CompEs, CompSci, and EEs mainly). He would prefer PhD students if possible, but is totally open to Masters students.

At Ecole Polytechnique, Masters & PhD classes are in English. So it doesn't matter if students do not know French while living in Montreal - you can totally get by knowing 0 French. Montreal was also recently rated the best student city in the world. So you can have a lot of fun year round!

Anyways, people are encouraged to direct any questions to:
bangotti@ualberta.ca
The deadline for applications is in May for Canadian Students. I think International Student deadlines may have passed already. It’s a great opportunity to work with a fantastic team and research a lot into autonomous robotics and swarm behaviours.
