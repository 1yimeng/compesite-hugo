### 1)  Web Dev 101 - Jobber JUMP Event
**WHO:** Students who want to learn web dev
**WHEN:**  March 11th from 5:30pm - 8:00pm
**WHERE:** [Jobber HQ - 4th Floor, 10520 Jasper Avenue](https://goo.gl/maps/rP951rUysx2ZapUs6), [RSVP HERE](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/jump-presents-web-dev-101-tickets-96518652889)
**WHAT:**  Nowadays web development is a part of almost **EVERY industry!**
Having a foundational understanding of web development concepts is sought out by employers, and will help you jump in with confidence as you work with or around web developers, or will help you as a web developer to build up your understanding from the ground up. We want to help you make that jump with Web Dev 101.
In this session you'll learn about:

Core concepts of how web applications work (and what happens behind the scenes when you type into the address the bar!).
Tools we use to build web applications (HTML, CSS, Javascript oh my!).
We'll give you access to a demo project that you can use to explore these concepts further.

**WHAT:**  Neuro Nexus is a hackathon program designed to spark collaboration across disciplines and tackle
complex challenges in brain science and mental health. The program connects experts in frontline,
clinical, and academic practice with motivated, talented students to develop technological solutions

### 3)  Leaders Prize Competition

**WHO:** Anyone interested in Aritificial Intelligence and Hackathons
**WHEN:**  June 19th 2019
**WHERE:** [Here](https://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com/en/)
**WHAT:**  Misinformation is rampant no matter where you look on the internet. Fact checkers and reputable news sources were a sufficient solution to keep well informed in the past, but this wave of fake news challenges that tradition. The Schulich Foundation invites you to tackle this problem with AI. Groups of up to 5 people are tasked with creating an AI that can evaluate the validity of the statement, and if possible, provide evidence. The winning team will claim the $1 milllion prize! This is a great experience to undertake. The competition is far off now, but it definatly worth your consideration!
