### 1. Startup Edmonton DemoCamp 33


**When:** Tuesday, November 22, 2016 from 6:45pm  8:45pm (doors open at 6:30)
**Where:** CCIS 1-140  University of Alberta
Drinks and networking to follow at RATT (Room At The Top) - 7th floor of the Students Union Building.

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

Hashtag is #democampyeg

### 3. UA-WISE Fall Coffee Night

**When:** Thursday, November 24, 2016 from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm
**Where:** ECHA 1-430

You are invited to UA-WISE's brand new event, Fall Coffee Night, which is an opportunity for students to engage and network with professionals from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Enjoy the opportunity to learn tips and tricks on how to gain work or research experience from professionals themselves.

Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the chance to talk one on one with recruiters and hiring managers on what they are looking for when hiring new grads or current undergraduate students. We hope that this event can lead to future possibilities for students, or at least offer direction on how to obtain those possibilities.

Please come out to the event ready to talk to professionals with questions and topics you would discuss with them!
