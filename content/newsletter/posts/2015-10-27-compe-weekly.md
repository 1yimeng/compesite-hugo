Curling Bonspiel
Saturday, November 7th, 2015
It's that time of year again! Join us for the 5th annual Computer Engineering Curling Bonspiel. It will be hosted on November 7 at the Granite Curling Club. Sign up and more information is available in the Computer Engineering Club room (ETLC E2-040M). It requires teams of 4, $30 per person, and your spot is secure once you and your team has paid. Dinner and equipment will be provided. Space is limited so sign up soon! If you don't have a team, come to the Computer Engineering Room and tell us your name and we'll contact you if we find enough individuals to form a team for you. Players of all skill levels are welcome.

Halloween Trick or Treating
Friday, October 30th, 2015
Dress up on Friday to get candies from the club rooms in ETLC. Especially if you have a midterm that day. Nothing will give you more confidence for your test than a ridiculous costume and some sugar.
