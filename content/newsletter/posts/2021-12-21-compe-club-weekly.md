**WHAT:** HackED is a 24-hour hackathon put on by the Computer Engineering Club each year. For 2022, it will be held in a hybrid format between 11:00 am on Saturday, January 15th and 7:00 pm Sunday, January 16th! This means that (pandemic dependent) there will be 80 open spaces for U of A students to join the event in-person in the DICE building. Either in-person or virtually, teams of up to six university students will work together to make incredible hardware or software projects over the 24-hour hacking period. Then teams will have the opportunity to present their finished projects to a panel of industry judges for the chance to win awesome prizes!
