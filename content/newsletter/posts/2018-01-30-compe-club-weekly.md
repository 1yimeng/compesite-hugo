### 1. HackED Hacks On

Comp E Club's annual hackathon, HackED, happened over the weekend. Thank you to everyone who came out through all the snow to participate, mentor, or volunteer! Also, thank you to all of our sponsors: U of A's ECE Department, HackerEarth, ATB, DevFacto, Telus, Jobber, and especially Intuit. We couldn't have done it without you!

The winners are as follows:

First Place : "Piley the Pylon"
by: Nathan Doraty, Michael Steer, Rafaella Graña, Mike Bardwell, and Robin Verleun
* "Piley the Pylon" is a twitch-controlled Pylon that can move and speak.
* check out their project page (https://hacked2018.hackerearth.com/sprints/hacked-2018-1/dashboard/4954aed/submission/)

Second Place : "pyBraille"
by: Alex Dong, kynan, Daniel Ren, and Jayden Chan.
* "PyBraille" is a software project that allows someone to take a picture with their phone or upload a photo and have it convert all the text to braille. It also has a hardware component that uses an arduino to display braille (since refreshable braille displays are expensive).
* check out their project page (https://hacked2018.hackerearth.com/sprints/hacked-2018-1/dashboard/38e25e1/submission/) .

Third Place : "The Name of the Game"
by: Joseph Meleshko, Arseniy Kouzmenkov, Jacob Paton, and Patrisha de Boon
* The Name Of The Game" is a platformer game, in which the gameplay revolves around controlling the environment with a terminal so that the character gets to the flag. It introduces the player to the Command Line and teaches the player how to think computationally.
* check out their project page (https://hacked2018.hackerearth.com/sprints/hacked-2018-1/dashboard/7f1d9b7/submission/) .

Again, thank you to all of our volunteers, sponsors, and everyone who braved the weather to attend. See you all next year!

### 2. DemoCamp 39

**When:** Wednesday, January 31 (6:30 pm doors open, 6:45 pm program starts)
**Where:** CCIS L2-190

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

If you've got anything you'd like to show off (from, say, a hackathon), reach out to Warren at warren@startupedmonton.com (mailto:warren@startupedmonton.com?subject=DemoCamp%2039%20Presentation) .

RSVP here (http://www.startupedmonton.com/democamp?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=60145823&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6SGkbN4RplBx7Xnytac5EmD7OQ-q7JDIeYnBw7qFtas5Fo8ncEz9KERu56uyYWGjzM2kFRvKHZod40j0QpKfogoPzhA&_hsmi=60145823) .

### 3. HackTime: now with an even better space!

**When:** Monday 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ECERF by the Nano Fab

HackTime is back this semester with an exciting new style!

The last Monday of every month we'll be holding a demo day where you can come present your projects and munch on some free pizza! If you're interested send an e-mail to social@compeclub.com (mailto:social@compeclub.com) to reserve your chance to present, otherwise you can drop by to enjoy some demos.

We'll still be holding study and help sessions every Monday and we would be glad to see you come by for help, to give mentorship, or just to hang out.

There will even be free snacks! If your new year’s resolution is to meet new people and make new friends, this is the event for you!
