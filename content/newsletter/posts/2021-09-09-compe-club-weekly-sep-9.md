Getting employed is stressful. The whole process of writing resumes, doing interviews, and integrating into the workplace can leave a lot of people lost and confused. Luckily, we've dedicated a whole week to help you start with your best foot forward. CompE Week is 5 days of on campus events that will help you navigate the computer engineering landscape. Resume reviews, mock interviews, and an opportunity to meet a Computer Engineer are just some of what you can expect to see. We hope to see you all there!
