### 2)  Google Design Sprints - Jobber JUMP

**WHO:** Anyone interested in learning industry practices
**WHEN:**  Wednesday September 18th @ 5:00 pm - 8:30pm
**WHERE:** Jobber HQ - 4th floor, 10520 Jasper Avenue, Edmonton
**WHAT:** Design Sprints were created to help answer critical business questions. It's a five-phase process that allows teams to rapidly prototype ideas and gain valuable learnings by testing their solutions on real people. You can also fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments.

Join us for a fun, fast-paced, hands-on workshop on Wednesday, September 18th from 5:30pm to 8:30pm at Jobber HQ. We'll break into sprint teams consisting of a wide range of skills, and learn how to do Google's original sprint process. Each team will select a sample business problem, break it down, sketch solutions, and decide which ideas to test with people from other teams. We'll learn how to spark innovation and launch proven solutions faster with Google Design Sprints.

Groups of up to 5 people are tasked with creating an AI that can evaluate the validity of the statement, and if possible, provide evidence. The winning team will claim the $1 milllion prize! This is a great experience to undertake. The competition is far off now, but it definatly worth your consideration!
