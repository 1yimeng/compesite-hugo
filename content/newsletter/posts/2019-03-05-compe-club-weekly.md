### 11) Breaking Barriers: Jobber JUMP

**WHERE:** Jobber HQ - 4th floor, 10520 Jasper Avenue
**WHEN:** Wednesday, March 6th @ 5:30PM to 8:30PM
**WHAT:**When you look around your classroom, do you notice a lack of diversity?Chances are, you’ll notice a higher proportion of men who are attending classes for anything science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) related. According to a McKinsey & Company Canada report released in 2016, women only make up 28% of STEM graduates and 23% of people employed in STEM. These percentages decrease if you start bringing in other diversity factors, such as other cultures, sexual orientation, or beliefs.

While programs are being created to start increasing diversity in these industries, there also needs to be an environment created within the workplace where people feel like the can grow their career, experience success, and ultimately feel as if they belong.

At this event, we'll tackle questions about the importance of an inclusive working environment, what they’re doing to challenge the stereotype of working in technology, and the importance of creating advocates and building awareness about bias.
