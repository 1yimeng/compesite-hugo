### 2. Geer Week

Jan 10th - 17th
Geer Week is a series of events where the different engineering discipline clubs compete to become the faculty champions. We placed third last year, and are already well on the way to becoming this year's winners.
The most important thing for competitions is having people participate. Even if you're not in Computer Engineering, we would love to have tons of people competing for us at the events. Please come visit our club room or email Brittany at <internal@compeclub.com> if you have any questions. [Facebook event can be found here.](https://www.facebook.com/events/633298233445269/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming) Our theme this year is 'Fedora in the Internet Explorer,' and our movie is on the way to becoming the greatest Geer Week movie ever.

If you would like to participate, we highly encourage you to visit the ESS Front Desk (beside Tim Hortons in ETLC) on Friday the 9th to register as a participant for Computer Engineering club. We get spirit points for every person who signs up early.

### 3. HackED

Jan 31st - Feb 1st
This is the second year of our student hack-a-thon. This 24 hour event is held downtown at Startup Edmonton where participants have the duration to come up with an idea and then make that idea a reality. This year we will provide space for students to hack with hardware tools.

There will be prizes for different categories donated from sponsors, with more details to come. Tickets will be available from the Computer Engineering Club and will include free food from our sponsors. Start brainstorming and we will see you at the end of the month.

Website to come soon.

### 4. ECE Week

Jan 26th - 30th
The Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Engineering Physics clubs are proud to present the first ever ECE Week. This week will include Tech Talks from various companies, tabling from the clubs, and a Company-Student Mixer. This is a great opportunity for first years to get more information about ECE and for current students to network with a variety of companies. We hope to see you there.
