It's week 2, and labs are starting. While ending school at 1:00pm might soon be a distant memory, at least you can say you're getting the most out of your tuition. One of the best ways to wring every ounce of value from the likely exhorbatant sums you're paying (make sure to cancel your dental plan if you don't need it btw) is to attend all the events you have access to as a student. What better place to start than the events below!

**NOTE:** With online lab delivery, there can be complications. If you have any course feedback you'd like us to voice to the faculty, please let us know via [email](mailto:interal@compeclub.com?subject=Feedback), the [CompE Discord](https://discord.gg/mJ7JScQ) or the [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/UFmW82zvR8g4LpdW8).
