Hackathons are for designing, creating, and building awesome projects. HackED is the premiere, annual, 24-hour hackathon from the Computer Engineering Club of the University of Alberta.

This event is for hackers who choose to learn because they can, and build because they love it. We’re about working together and applying yourself, your skills and your creativity.

Join us over the weekend of January 27 to hack your way to something new. Bring on the challenge, bring your ideas to life.

This event takes a lot of work to run. If you want to help give back to this event, please consider volunteering to help run the event (general running of stations, set up, tear down, etc.). Sign up for volunteers is here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee-wsEI1K-nBiu0OZoa8EKCQFPjpmdjsfDzGvrqOs08fe1hg/viewform?usp=sf_link) .

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

RSVP here (http://www.startupedmonton.com/democamp?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=60145823&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6SGkbN4RplBx7Xnytac5EmD7OQ-q7JDIeYnBw7qFtas5Fo8ncEz9KERu56uyYWGjzM2kFRvKHZod40j0QpKfogoPzhA&_hsmi=60145823) .

**Where:** ECHA L1-150

On Wednesday January 31^st, Friends Across Campus will be hosting a Speed Friending and Paint Night event in ECHA L1-150 from 6:00-8:00pm. Speed Friending is a lot like speed dating, except the goal is to meet new people from across campus and make new friends! We know that it can be nerve wracking to approach new people on campus, so we hope to provide a safe, tolerant, and inclusive environment where students from diverse backgrounds can get to know each other over ice-breaker questions and painting! There will even be free snacks! If your new year’s resolution is to meet new people and make new friends, this is the event for you!
