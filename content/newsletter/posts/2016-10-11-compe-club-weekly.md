### 1. FREE Digital Security Sessions by Panda Rose

**When:** Thursdays at 5pm, starting October 13 (for 4 weeks)
**Where:** MecE 2-3

The CTO of Panda Rose Consulting Studios Inc has generously decided to give 4 free lectures on digital security. The topics covered are as follows:
* Talk 1: Digital Security
* Talk 2: Privacy and Encryption
* Talk 3: Authentication and Non-Repudiation
* Talk 4: Putting it all together

This week is the first talk, which will be about digital security. Everyone, from the smallest personal interaction to the largest multi-faceted business, needs it. Everybody wants to know how to keep it, how to fix it when it gets breached, and what to do when it just isn't there in the way it should be. Every day it becomes more important as we become a cloud-based connected society. This talk will cover the pillars of digital security, how to develop in a digitally secure way, and some of the ways we all can stay on top of the news and innovations that keep everyone safe.

Want to make $5000 in one day, legally?
Come show off your skills at Code/Design to Win! It’s exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards.

But seriously, what is it
Code/Design to Win is a good old fashioned skills competition. If you’re a student who loves computer science, programming background or design (UX/UI) and attend one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you.

How does one apply?
First, you’ll have to write the preliminary exam (don’t worry, you got this) on October 24th. The top students will be invited to the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Region on January 21, 2017 to participate in the finals, meet with some really great companies, and have your shot at taking home $5,000!

Am I eligible to win the moneys?
