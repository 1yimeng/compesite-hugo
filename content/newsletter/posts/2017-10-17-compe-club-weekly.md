### 1. Microsoft at UAlberta


Hello UAlberta! Our names are Monica Bui and Sarah Hoven and we are your new Microsoft Student Partners at UofA.

What this means is that we will be a liaison between the Microsoft community and the University. With the support of Microsoft, we plan to host workshops and events to provide opportunities for our students to learn and explore new technologies. This role allows us to make our university more visible with not just Microsoft but the tech community itself!

Please like and follow our Facebook (facebook.com/mspualberta) and Twitter (@mspualberta) accounts to stay updated on future info. Our main email is mspualberta@outlook.com (mailto:mspualberta@outlook.com)  if you wish to contact us.


Thank you UofA and we hope to make this year awesome!

### 2. Academic Speed Dating (CSGSA)

**When:** October 19, 5 pm - 7 pm
**Where:** Tentatively the Heritage Lounge in Athabasca Hall, or a larger venue
depending on the number of participants.

We, the Computing Science Graduate Students' Association (http://uacsgsa.blogspot.ca/) are inviting undergraduate students interested in research and graduate studies to a speed dating-format event where they can meet with faculty, graduate students, and other research staff in the Computing Science Department. We hope the event answers people's questions about academic pursuits after graduation, and provides a good atmosphere for socializing. This year, we are opening the event to students outside the Computing Science department, in fields connected with computing.

There will be some refreshments during the event.

### 3. LEED Green Associate (GA) Training

**When:** October 28, 12:30 pm to 5 pm
**Where:** University of Alberta - Students Union Building - Room 0-51

Want to get involved in sustainability? Opportunities are plentiful and LEED is at the forefront!

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a sustainability scorecard for green buildings. Buildings can become LEED Certified as can people! The LEED Green Associate is the only professional designation to show employers and clients you have certified knowledge in the field.

To date, this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping over 8000 students pass their respective exam at a 100% pass rate. This course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their name!

This course meets the examâ€™s eligibility requirements and the USGBC charges a $100 (reduced for students) fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time at your nearest Prometric center. Save money by reserving your spot today and make a positive difference in your career!

If you are worried about your busy schedule, fear not, as the course is entirely recorded and you can watch the part that you cannot attend or take the whole course online.

This professional designation never expires and you will never have to retest if you pass now!

Early-Bird Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)

### 5. Hack Time

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1 - 008

Hey Guys! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Student's can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
