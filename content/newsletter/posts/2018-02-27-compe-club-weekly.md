### Winter AGM/Election Forum on Friday

Computer Engineering Club Senior Executive elections are coming up on March 7th and 8th and we'd love to see some bright new faces running for positions. A fair number of Sr. Execs are graduating this year and we're excited to pass on the torch to the next generation of Comp Es who want to help improve student life for themselves and their peers. The deadline for nominations for the positions is noon on Thursday, March 1.

This Friday (March 2) is the Comp E Club Winter AGM. This meeting is important for all Comp E students, as we'll be proposing and voting on changes to the club's constitution. This meeting also serves as an election forum for all candidates nominated for Sr. Exec positions. Be sure to come out to see what's new and to figure out who you want to elect as next year's Comp E leadership! Plus, there will be FREE PIZZA!

If you're looking to keep warm, Comp E hoodies are now available for order.

### 4. AlbertaAI Talk: Embracing AI for Medical Simulation Design - the Human Factors Approach
**When:** 7:00 - 9:30 pm, Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018
**Where:** 1-040 (Oborowsky Degner Seminar Hall), Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, University of Alberta

Speaker: Dr. Bin Zheng, Associate Professor in Surgery & Endowed Research Chair in Surgical Simulation, Department of Surgery, University of Alberta
Organizers: AlbertaAI, IEEE-NCS, Surgical Simulation Research Lab at University of Alberta
Partners: UA-CGSC, Edmonton IT Club, Tsinghua Alumni Association of Edmonton (TAAE)

Abstract:
Designing medical simulation for medical use is not an easy task. I take a human factors approach to this challenge as I would like to ensure surgeon can gain maximum benefit from practicing with simulation. In the past a few years, my researchers focus on the visual presentation and teleoperation innovation. In this presentation, I will summarize knowledge learned from two projects we did in the field of image representation, stereo-perception and mixed virtual-reality perception. We will discuss how a surgeon acquires stereopsis (visual judgment on depth) and acquire skills under augmented reality. I may briefly introduce works we did in the teleoperation if time allows. The core of these studies is our understanding on users (surgeons). Human factors provide a sound foundation of the study of artificial intelligence.
At the end of this workshop, audiences are expected to learn:
1.     the basis of image-guided and robotic surgery
2.     the basis of human factors in surgery
3.     the connection of human factors to AI

Agenda:
19:00 - 19:15 Opening Introductions - Organizers, Sponsors, VIP
19:15 - 20:45 Embracing AI for Medical Simulation Design - the Human Factors Approach (by Dr. Bin Zheng)
20:45 - 21:30 Idea Pitch and Discussion - How to Apply AI in Medical (Hosted by Dr. Lihang Ying, prepare your brilliant ideas in advance, pitch them to the audience and get feedback )
Language: English

Webinar: https://zoom.us/j/2017110000 (https://albertaai.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b4bd36d16dbbe7e6e36901c60&id=e9b364aa6e&e=509e03c41c)  (need to install for the first time.)
