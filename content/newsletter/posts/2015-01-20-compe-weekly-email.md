### CompE Won Geer Week

Thank you to everyone who came out to events to participate or just cheer on the team. It's time for us to get back to real world, so here is what is coming up from CompE:

1. ECE Week
2. HackED
3. GEER Week

</br>

### 1. ECE Week

Jan 26th - Jan 30th
The Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Engineering Physics clubs are proud to present the first ever ECE Week. This week will include Tech Talks from various companies, tabling from the clubs, and a student-industry mixer. Whether you are a first year looking to get into ECE, or are already in your discipline and are looking to sit back and have a beer with Engineers from industry, learn about cool stuff happening in industry, or find a job, ECE Week is for you!

RSVP (it's free!) on the ECE Week website here: <https://www.eceweek.compeclub.com>, and be sure to bring your resume to the industry mixer on Friday!

### 2. HackED

Jan 31st - Feb 1st
Have an idea for an app, embedded system, or other doohickey? The second annual CompE hackathon is coming at the end of January. With over $2000 in prizes, industry reps looking to hire top talent, and 24 hours of fun, HackED is the best place to build your awesome ideas, and get noticed by recruiters (nevermind win cool stuff!)

Getting started is simple: register yourself right away at <https://hackathon.compeclub.com>, and start brainstorming. Then on January 31st, code, tinker, and hack your way to first place in groups of up to three members!

Lastly, a shout-out to our amazing sponsors: (and did we mention that they're hiring?)
* Google
* Microsoft
* GitHub
* Intuit
* Startup Edmonton
