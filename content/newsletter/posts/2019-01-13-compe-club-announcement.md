### GEER Tug of War Event


**WHO:** Y'all who were interested
**WHEN:** Monday, January, 14th @ 12:00pm - 1:00pm
**WHERE:**  Main Quad
**WHAT:**  The Tug of War is a semi round robin competition. Each teams pulls three times before the finals. No team will participate in back-to-back pulls without an adequate break. Teams will be ranked according to how many wins they have, and then by how fast they won. Time taken to lose a pull is not taken into account. The top 4 teams will participate in semi-final and final matches, with 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3 in the semi-final, then the winners play off for 1st and 2nd and the losers play for 3rd and 4th. Ranking after 4th place will be determined off number of wins and time it took to win.

Each pull is started with a starterâ€™s whistle. How far the rope must be pulled for a team to win will be set at the event by the organizing club. A team wins when a flag on either side of the rope is pulled past where the middle of the rope started.
