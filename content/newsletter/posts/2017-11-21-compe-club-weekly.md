### Major League Hacking and ECE Grad Banquet

Welcome back from reading week! Hopefully it was restful and not too loaded with school work. During reading week we had our fall hackathon, which ended up being a smashing success! The winners have been announced on our facebook page, with photos of each of their projects. Topics of interest this week include: an ECE Grad Banquet Survey, and a local hack day being organized by the Microsoft Student Partners at the UofA!

### 1. Datathon - Edmonton Community Foundation


On the weekend of November 24 to 26 we need volunteers with experience manipulating, analysing, and interpreting data. Participants will spend the day crunching a massive collection of information to figure out how to use data to make our city and province better.

Sign up information can be found here: https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/edmonton-community-datathon-2017-tickets-39130434182

On Friday November 24, at 4:30 PM, just before the start of the Datathon, we’re hosting a workshop on data analysis. Participants will learn to use more powerful data analytics tools (a step up from Excel). If you already manage data for your charity or organization this is a great opportunity for you to advance your skills, and a great way to get ready for the Datathon!

Registration  for the workshop is here (space is limited):  https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/data-for-good-edmonton-15509784797


Chunks of information from across the charitable and non-profit sectors (over 3 gigs of raw data and counting) that have never been brought together before will be analysed. On Sunday the trends and findings will be presented to the community. Some examples of data sources include:


* Edmonton Community Foundation
* City of Edmonton FCSS / United Way / Alberta Human Services Common Outcomes Report
* Canadian Mental Health Association 211
* The Government of Alberta (particularly the Ministry of Culture and Tourism)
* Canada Revenue Agency


A linked event will be happening at the University of Calgary hosted by the Calgary Foundation and Data For Good Calgary.

Please feel free to join for any aspects you find interesting. The entire event will be at Edmonton Community Foundation’s office, 9910 103 St NW, Edmonton Alberta.

### 4. Army Communication and Information System Specialist

Hello Computer Engineering Club,   I am Warrant Officer Justin Slind, Recruiting Representative for 1 Squadron, 41 Signal Regiment.  In Feb 2017 I informed your student group of a briefing on the Army Communication and Information Systems Specialist (ACISS) trade.  We had a great turn out and have since hired 3 students from the University of Alberta.  We are hoping to hire more and will be holding another briefing on 29 November, 2017.

We are an Army Reserve Communications unit in Edmonton and currently looking to hire in the Army Communication and Information Systems Specialist trade.  This trade provides communication support through radios, satellite, line, and information systems equipment.  We train on Wednesday evenings and weekends as well as conduct full time training in the summer months.  All training is paid.  We also have a tuition reimbursement program that offers up to $2000 per year up to 4 years for eligible students.  There is no required period of service.  Army Reservists are not required to do military moves or deploy overseas.

I'm hoping you can pass on to your membership that we will be running an introduction briefing on the ACISS trade on Wednesday evening 29 November, at 7:30 pm to explain what this trade does in more depth, how to apply, as well as provide a tour of our facility.  This briefing will occur at LCol Philip L Debney Armoury in Southeast Edmonton (8403 Roper Road (https://maps.google.com/?q=Southeast+Edmonton+(8403+Roper+Road&entry=gmail&source=g) ).  There is no commitment necessary to attend and anyone interested can bring guests.  If they are interested in attending, they must email join1sqn@gmail.com (mailto:join1sqn@gmail.com)  with their names and names of any guests.

If anyone is interested in these positions but not able to make it on Wednesday 29 Nov, they are welcome to email me at join1sqn@gmail.com (mailto:join1sqn@gmail.com)  and we can make alternate arrangements.
