**WHERE:** Here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFszWccXEGZ2qFuTMxd6uvK_gsycFLSlgAZUnyQfVlhUge-Q/viewform)
**WHAT:**  We're excited to introduce the UofA's newest student project group! Albertaloop aims to design, build, and compete a Hyperloop pod in the annual Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by SpaceX. Tentatively, Albertaloop is aiming to compete our first pod in the 2021 iteration of the competition. We're looking for people interested in technical positions (e.g., engineering and science students) as well as non-technical positions (e.g., business students); graduate students are also encouraged to join. Click the link below and fill out the membership form if you're interested to stay "in-the-loop" for our first general meeting in Fall 2019!
