### 1. DemoCamp

Tuesday February 10th @ 6:30pm
Start Up Edmonton is hosting DemoCamp this Tuesday in CCIS 1-160. This is an event that brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they's been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. One of the demos being featured is HackED second place winner Broom Blaster - if you're interested in some cool tech that was built in 24 hours come and check out DemoCamp.

### 2. Winter AGM

Wednesday, February 11th @ 5:00pm
Our Winter AGM will be taking place on February 11th at 5pm in ATCO Design Lab. There will be PIZZA as usual, and we will be hearing Campaign Speeches for next year's executive. We will also be discussing next year's Geer Week theme. We currently have so many ideas that we are going to have to cut down the list before AGM. Some of the ideas include Hack To The Future, The Hex Files, My Big Fat Compiler Warning, Kernel Space Program, and more.
This is also an opportunity for first years to see how the Computer Engineering Club operates and as such are welcome at the meeting.
