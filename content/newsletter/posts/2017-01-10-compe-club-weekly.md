### 2. Weekly Coding Event Interest Survey


We are trying to coordinate social coding events for Comp E starting this year. We're sending out a survey to gauge interest.

The plan is to book a room on a weekly basis where people can go to work on personal projects and get mentorship from later year students. Also we wanted to eventually have people do small guided sessions where they do a tutorial on a language/library/project that they know or are working on.

Please fill out this[ survey ](https://compeclub1.typeform.com/to/lneGSx) to provide feedback for this idea if you'd like to see this happen.

### 3. ECE Week 2017

It's here once again! January is for ECE Week!

CompE, EE, and EngPys clubs present to you a week-long event where you get to interact with different companies in the tech industry as well as opportunities to learn in workshops conducted by industry representatives.

Keep on lookout on the [ECE Week website ](http://eceweek.compeclub.com)  and the next newsletter for more details on the events happening that week.

### 4. HackEd 2017

HackEd fall turned out great last November. A number of beginners and non-beginners showed up and learned and worked with mentors from different companies.
As part of the annual ECE Week, we are having another hackathon - HackEd 2017. It's bigger and better and more competitive!

This time it's a [Major League Hacking ](https://mlh.io/)  event.

Our goal is to bring together motivated students from diverse, interdisciplinary backgrounds and challenge them to build something awesome in a collaborative and competitive environment.

This year's hackathon will be on January 28 - 29 at Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 104 St Mercer Warehouse).

### 8. Volunteer Opportunity: CHOICES Conference 2017

Greetings from WISEST!

We would like to invite you to consider volunteering for WISEST's upcoming CHOICES Conference for Grade 6 girls, scheduled to take place over Reading Week on February 21 & 22, 2017.

Our CHOICES Conference will bring 300 girls to the U of A on both Feb. 21 & 22 (for a total of 600 students!). Our goal is to get these young women excited about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through hands-on, fun, and engaging activities.  These activities would not be possible without the tremendous support that we receive from our volunteers.

We are currently looking for individuals to fill the following roles:

Science Activity Leaders -  Undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, lab coordinators, and professionals can all volunteer to lead or assist with a lab activity related to their field of interest.  We generally ask volunteers to commit to delivering their activity twice on each day of the conference but can possibly take volunteers who can only commit to one day. We are open to hearing your ideas for new activities or can suggest some tried and tested activities from previous CHOICES Conferences!

[SIGN UP HERE! ](https://goo.gl/forms/wjUgbZ8Mg98CmPpx2)

Campus Ambassadors and General Volunteers - Undergraduates, graduate or PhD students, and high school students are all welcome to consider either of these volunteer roles. Campus Ambassadors help to guide students around campus while General Volunteers assist with event logistics like set up, registration, signage, clean up, etc.

[SIGN UP HERE!  ](https://goo.gl/forms/4gaJvsDIY0Qkl07h1)

For additional details, please visit the [WISEST website](http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/Programs/ChoicesConference/VolunteerforChoices) . (http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/Programs/ChoicesConference/VolunteerforChoices)

All volunteers who sign up will be contacted to confirm their participation and to provide further details via the email addresses submitted. We hope that you consider helping WISEST for this amazing event and we are happy to answer any additional questions that you have - just email us at [wisest@ualberta.ca ](mailto:wisest@ualberta.ca) .
