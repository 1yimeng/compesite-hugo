### [Follow-up announcement]

Sorry for the extra email this week. Just more one thing worth mentioning that we forgot from the last newsletter.

Startup Edmonton DemoCamp32

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

* **When:** Thursday, September 22, 2016
* **Time:** 6:30 pm doors open, 6:45 pm program starts
*** Location:** CCIS 1-160, University of Alberta

Drinks and networking to follow at RATT (Room At The Top) - 7th floor of the Students Union Building
