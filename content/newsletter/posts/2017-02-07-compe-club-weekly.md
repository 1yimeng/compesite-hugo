### 5. Weekly Coding Event Interest Survey


We are trying to coordinate social coding events for Comp E starting this year. We're sending out a survey to gauge interest.

The plan is to book a room on a weekly basis where people can go to work on personal projects and get mentorship from later year students. Also we wanted to eventually have people do small guided sessions where they do a tutorial on a language/library/project that they know or are working on.

Please fill out this [survey ](https://compeclub1.typeform.com/to/lneGSx) to provide feedback for this idea if you'd like to see this happen.

### 9. Volunteer Opportunity: CHOICES Conference 2017

Greetings from WISEST!

We would like to invite you to consider volunteering for WISEST's upcoming CHOICES Conference for Grade 6 girls, scheduled to take place over Reading Week on February 21 & 22, 2017.

Our CHOICES Conference will bring 300 girls to the U of A on both Feb. 21 & 22 (for a total of 600 students!). Our goal is to get these young women excited about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through hands-on, fun, and engaging activities.  These activities would not be possible without the tremendous support that we receive from our volunteers.

We are currently looking for individuals to fill the following roles:

Science Activity Leaders -  Undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, lab coordinators, and professionals can all volunteer to lead or assist with a lab activity related to their field of interest.  We generally ask volunteers to commit to delivering their activity twice on each day of the conference but can possibly take volunteers who can only commit to one day. We are open to hearing your ideas for new activities or can suggest some tried and tested activities from previous CHOICES Conferences!

[SIGN UP HERE! ](https://goo.gl/forms/wjUgbZ8Mg98CmPpx2)

Campus Ambassadors and General Volunteers - Undergraduates, graduate or PhD students, and high school students are all welcome to consider either of these volunteer roles. Campus Ambassadors help to guide students around campus while General Volunteers assist with event logistics like set up, registration, signage, clean up, etc.

[SIGN UP HERE! ] (https://goo.gl/forms/4gaJvsDIY0Qkl07h1)

### 11. LEED Green Associate Training

**When:** March 4^th 2017 – 12:00PM to 5:00 PM
**Where:** University of Alberta – ECHA – Room 1-182 - https://goo.gl/maps/uT5Lh
Registration: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/

Interested in getting involved in the Green Building and sustainability Industry? Opportunities are plentiful and passing your LEED professional designation is required to get involved!

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a green-rating point system to certify a building’s sustainability. Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, students and professional can become LEED Accredited themselves.  The LEED Green Associate (GA) credential is the only professional designation used to market yourself to employers and clients and show you have certified knowledge in the green building industry.

To date, this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping over 7000 students pass their exam at a 100% pass rate and does not require any specific background. This course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their name and it never expires!

Also, a new LEED rating system (v4) was introduced this year and this training course is one of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system to ensure your knowledge is up to date! This course meets the exam’s eligibility requirements and the USGBC charges a $100 (reduced for students) fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time at your nearest Prometric center.

Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)
To register for the class please visit: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/
You can register via PayPal or RSVP your attendance by registering at the bottom of the page
