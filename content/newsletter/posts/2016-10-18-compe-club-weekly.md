**When:** Thursdays at 5pm, starting October 13 (for 4 weeks)
**Where:** MecE 2-3

The CTO of Panda Rose Consulting Studios Inc has generously decided to give 4 free lectures on digital security. The topics covered are as follows:
* Talk 1: Digital Security
* Talk 2: Privacy and Encryption
* Talk 3: Authentication and Non-Repudiation
* Talk 4: Putting it all together

This week is the second talk, which will be about privacy and encryption.  Privacy is more complicated than just "keeping your information safe." This talk covers the myriad ways that privacy can be breached, and what tools exist to prevent these violations. As well, cryptographic standards around encryption will be discussed, which will provide a beginner with the basics needed to develop secure software efficiently.

### 5. Communitech's Code/Design to Win


**When:**  24th of October from 5-7pm
**Where:** ETLC E2-001 and E2-002

Want to make $5000 in one day, legally?
Come show off your skills at Code/Design to Win! It’s exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards.

But seriously, what is it
Code/Design to Win is a good old fashioned skills competition. If you’re a student who loves computer science, programming background or design (UX/UI) and attend one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you.

How does one apply?
First, you’ll have to write the preliminary exam (don’t worry, you got this) on October 24th. The top students will be invited to the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Region on January 21, 2017 to participate in the finals, meet with some really great companies, and have your shot at taking home $5,000!

Am I eligible to win the moneys?
University of Alberta is one of the 13 [universities ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=735fccd1c1&e=5ed82361f6)  across the country involved with this event.
