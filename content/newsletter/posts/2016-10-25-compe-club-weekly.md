### 3. FREE Digital Security Sessions by Panda Rose

**When:** Thursdays at 5pm, starting October 13 (for 4 weeks)
**Where:** MecE 2-3

The CTO of Panda Rose Consulting Studios Inc has generously decided to give 4 free lectures on digital security. The topics covered are as follows:
* Talk 1: Digital Security
* Talk 2: Privacy and Encryption
* Talk 3: Authentication and Non-Repudiation
* Talk 4: Putting it all together

This week is the third talk, which will be about authentication and non-repudiation.  How do you know who you're really talking to online? How do you know that they will not pretend that they didn't agree to the contract they signed? These two questions seem basic at first, but answering them is key to creating digitally secure systems for reliable transactions.

This talk will go over the primary techniques used to establish authentication, as well as modern achievements around non-repudiation and public ledgers (including BitCoin!) which can be used to determine ownership and contractual obligations digitally.

### 4. HackEd Fall: A 24-hour hackathon by the Computer Engineering Club
**When:** November 12-13
