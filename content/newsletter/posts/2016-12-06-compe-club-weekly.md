### Good Luck on Exams!


We did it! We made it through the semester mostly unscathed. Now we just need to pound through a few finals and then we can get some much needed R&R. Good job and good luck on finals everyone. See you in the new year!

In this issue:
1. UACS LAN Party
2. Job Posting: Huawei
3. Quantum Computing Undergraduate Research Opportunities
4. Be part of the CompE Club dance troupe for Geer Week!

### 1. UACS LAN Party


**When:** December 9th - 10th, 12:00pm - 12:00pm (24 hours)
**Where:** CSC Building Main Floor

Comp Sci's end of the year LAN party is this weekend!

The LAN party is always at the end of the semester and is when we hook up a bunch of Steam games and the like on the lab machines and all get together to play! There is also food, tournaments, and consoles are typically brought in to play games. It's after classes end and offer a good way to just relax after the stressful semester that is schoolness.

Some of the games we will have up on the lab machines include:

Overwatch
DOTA
Rocket League
League of Legends
And many more!
There will also be board games and some classic Super Smash Bros!

Please feel free to bring in your own consoles, games or board games that you would like to play! The more games the merrier!

If anyone has any game suggestions that they would like to see, feel free to email the UACS Junior Rep, Chris at <juniorrep@uacs.ca>

### 2. Job Posting: Huawei


Description
Full-time and Co-op/intern positions available at Canada Research Center@Markham

The position belongs to the Canada branch of the Programming Technologies Lab of Huawei, whose mission is to innovate and leverage programming technologies (compilers, languages, language VMs, tools) to improve the performance, productivity, and quality of Huawei software.

As a member of a highly talented team, you get to do creative work as well as making real impact by solving real customer problems. While the current projects include language design, compiler & JVM, and performance optimization, the lab continues to grow and expand into new domains (e.g., cloud, smart devices, IoT). As such, we are not looking for people w/ a fixed set of skills, but rather the “growth-mindset” people who have a versatile experience in the field and are not daunted by acquiring new skills. We especially welcome researchers and problem solvers.

The Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) would like to share the following information with students:

</br>

### Be a part of world-class research this summer


</br>

### Learn about quantum information processing and gain research experience


At the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) we have a couple of different learning opportunities available for undergraduate students interested in quantum information processing.

Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) - May 29-June 9
Start the summer with a [two-week introduction ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=6e28c420bd&e=5ed82361f6)  to the theoretical and experimental study of quantum information processing which includes 30 hours in the labs. You will get the opportunity to interact with students from around world, work with graduate students, postdocs and IQC faculty. This program is fully funded – including your accommodations and food. You can also apply for travel bursaries.
[Watch this quick video ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=75a29bbb7c&e=5ed82361f6)  to get a feel for the full experience.

Undergraduate Research Award - all summer
Join us at IQC for the summer through an[ Undergraduate Research Award ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=cd0f606897&e=5ed82361f6)  and work with one of our researchers – experimentalist or theorist. Not only will you enhance your research experience and prepare for your graduate studies and research career, but you get the chance to attend IQC seminars, lectures, and student talks. This is a unique opportunity to interact with an interdisciplinary research community.

Apply before January 9!
You can choose to only apply to attend USEQIP, to only apply for an Undergraduate Research Award, or apply for both.
* If you want to apply to both, complete the [USEQIP application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=b53471c1ff&e=5ed82361f6)  and check the appropriate box for the Undergraduate Research Award.*
* If you only want to apply for USEQIP, complete the [USEQIP application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=d1ced32c7e&e=5ed82361f6)  but do NOT check the box for the Undergraduate Research Award.
* If you only want to apply for the Undergraduate Research Award, complete the [URA application ](http://compeclub.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25f7181ad1da5b9eef1f7deea&id=19af1d9716&e=5ed82361f6) .

*In the event that you are not invited to USEQIP, you will still be considered for an Undergraduate Research Award as we have more URA opportunities than spots in USEQIP.
