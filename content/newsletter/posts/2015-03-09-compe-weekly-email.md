There will be a panel of UofA grads and people from the industry who will be speaking about their experiences and providing tips for success! It will also serve as an opportunity for people to hear a bit more about Startup Edmonton overall and the startup community (including job opportunities). There will be coffee and donuts for attendees. Some of the panelists include Jeff Lawrence from Granify and Crag Knox from OMx.
