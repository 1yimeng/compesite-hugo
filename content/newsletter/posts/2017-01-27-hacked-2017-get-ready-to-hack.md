Thank you for signing up to be a part of HackEd 2017, we’re excited to have you this weekend!

Some of you may have gotten this email already! The contents are the same, except for the last section about Devpost, so you can skip ahead to that if you want.

Here’s what everyone needs to know:


### Schedule:


The schedule can be found [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15udBLBbuN-XUt8-wk9KTdhfYg7dS_kt6LAhDhnyzA8M/edit?usp=sharing) ! Doors open at 10am for sign-ins and the opening ceremony will start at 11am. Hacking begins at 12 noon and ends at noon the next day. Judging begins at 1pm, followed by closing ceremonies at 2pm.

</br>

### HackEd Slack Team:


Join our Slack group [here ](http://hacked2017.slack.com/signup) ! The group is meant to make communication easier. We will be posting announcements throughout the hackathon. Student and industry mentors will also be available to reach out to, in case participants need help with their code or with any other general concerns.

</br>

### Forming teams:


If you don't have a team when you get there, there's nothing to worry about! There's a time designated for people to pitch their ideas and find a team. You can also get a head start by posting on the #find-a-team channel on Slack! You are also welcome to work on your own.


### Out of town participants & Remote participation:


For those registered participants who are not based in Edmonton, unfortunately we are not giving out travel reimbursements at this time. You will have to arrange your own travel plans to make it to the event. We encourage participants to be physically present at the event in order to foster a great, collaborative atmosphere however, we’re aware that not everyone will be able to make it. With that said, we would like to invite a few remote participants! Here are the rules for remote participation:
* You must be on a team where at least 50% of the members are physically present at the event.
* You will not be eligible for any major prizes or swag given during the event.

Please reply to us ASAP if you would like to participate remotely.

### MLH Hardware Lab

We are getting awesome hardware from MLH! If you are planning to work on a hardware project, check out our list of hardware [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJ7seUlO5khJZRkC9vILu03Y0JPr5-KyH-NXlX1_aIw/edit?usp=sharing) . If you know what hardware items your project needs, you can request it using this [form ](https://goo.gl/forms/GZvL6agA3fWfG4EC3) ! If you don’t know what your project is yet and will be deciding at the hackathon, hardware will also be available to rent during the event.

</br>

### What to bring

* Student ID*
* Computer setup
* Any hardware you might need (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, soldering iron, power supply), keep in mind the stuff we have in the Hardware Lab though!
* Power bar
* Headphones (to try not to disrupt people)
* Comfy clothes and shoes/slippers
* Sleeping bag/blankets
* Pillow
* Please do not bring alcohol or other substances!

* Only students (high school, undergraduate and graduate) are allowed to compete in the hackathon. If you are a new grad (i.e. graduated within the last 12 months), you can also compete! However, if you do not fit these criteria, you can still come out and join the fun by helping out other participants, or working on your own project, but you cannot be part of a team or be eligible for prizes.

</br>

### Doors


The doors at Startup will be unlocked from 8:30am to 9pm on Saturday, and 8:30am to 3pm on Sunday - if participants exit and need to re-enter outside of these times, you'll have to coordinate with one of the volunteers.

</br>

### Food


The schedule indicates when we are going to serve food. We will not be providing lunch on the first day (Nov 12). You can also bring your own food. Another option is to go to Mercer Tavern where we'll be giving away $5 coupons to all participants who sign up for a free student Commons Membership with [Startup ](http://www.startupedmonton.com/shop/commons-membership) ! We will provide food for dinner on the first day, as well as breakfast and lunch for day 2. We will also be serving snacks throughout the event.

</br>

### Parking


Your best option will be to coordinate with your team or arrange to be dropped off, but there are paid surface lots nearby in the event that you must bring a car. Another great option would be to Pogo, as you can find metered parking all along 104 St!

</br>

### How to get there


Here's [Startup Edmonton ](https://goo.gl/maps/vNns1vsP3vC2) on Google Maps. The address is 10359 104 Street Northwest and Startup is on the 3rd floor of the Mercer Building.
