We apologize to everyone who didn't see last Monday's email, the UAlberta spam filters decided we were being malicious. But it's fixed now! Well, if you're reading this it should be. Anywho, this week's email is pretty light. Here's events.

2. Curling Bonspiel
3. Solder Workshop
4. Edmonton Startup Week
5. New Logo...?
</br>

### 1. Extra-Life Gaming Marathon
Extra-Life is a 24-hour gaming marathon in support of children's hospitals. We will be playing for The Stollery Children's Hospital starting at 4pm on October 25 till 4pm on October 26th. You are welcome to play anything from XBox to Settlers of Catan. We will be taking over ETLC E1-003 and E1-013, don't forget to join the  team at [UofA Engineering Students](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=16934) as we game for a cause.

### 2. Curling Bonspiel

The Computer Engineering Club Curling Bonspiel will be taking place on November 15th, at the Granite Curling Club. Entry fee is $30/person, with teams of 4 -- this includes dinner, equipment rentals, a free tutorial for beginners, and lots of prizes! We highly encourage everyone to sign up early, since there are a limited number of teams in the roster.

Registration is open at the Computer Engineering Club (ETL E2-040M)!

### 3. Solder Workshop

We are working with the Edmonton New Technology Society to have some soldering workshops for students to learn to solder or improve their existing skills. The project and date will be decided on soon. Please email Andrew at [social@compeclub.com](mailto:social@compeclub.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20Soldering!)  if you're interested - we would like a rough estimate, so please email even if you have nothing to say.

### 4. Edmonton Startup Week

Startup Edmonton is hosting a Startup week from October 20th to the 24th. For more information, see their [schedule](http://edmontonstartupweek.com/#schedule) .

### 5. New Logo...?

We're looking at changing our logo, and we want your help! We have some ideas at this point but nothing we can all agree on so we want your ideas too! If you have any sketches, Photoshop masterpieces or any other design that might work as our new logo send them our way, to Brittany at [internal@compeclub.com](mailto:internal@compeclub.com) . You have until October 15th to get your submissions in, so don't hesitate to send us your ideas! Winning entry will receive a free (retro) CompE jacket!
