### Summer Newsletter - hackathon survey

Warm summer greetings! We hope your summer has been fun and relaxing.

As most of you know, the Computer Engineering Club hosts two hackathons every year. Looking ahead, we already have some big plans for these events! We are gathering information in order to enhance the hackathon experience. This form is for all students - whether or not you have attended a hackathon does not matter! We want your input. The survey will only take a few minutes.

CLICK HERE TO START THE SURVEY (https://compeclub1.typeform.com/to/xX1tCH) .

Thank you for participating. Only a few more months until school begins. Enjoy the summer while you can!
