### 1. New Executive

Our Fall General Meeting went craaaaazy good. Thank you all of the ~70 people who joined us! Through some stressful election shenanigans (which proved engineers are in fact NOT good at math), we would like to welcome our new executive members:
Second Year Rep: Arjun Kalburgi, Coop Rep: Derek Shultz, Stock Reps: Andy Keller, Stefan Martynkiw and Dannick Pomerleau, Geer Week Reps: Brittany Lamorie and Jacob Ortt.

### 2. Solder Workshop

We are working with the Edmonton New Technology Society to have some soldering workshops for students to learn to solder or improve their existing skills. The project and date will be decided on soon. Please email Andrew at [social@compeclub.com](mailto:social@compeclub.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20Soldering!)  if you're interested - we would like a rough estimate, so please email even if you have nothing to say.

### 3. Curling Bonspiel

The Computer Engineering Club Curling Bonspiel will be taking place on November 15th, at the Granite Curling Club. Entry fee is $30/person, with teams of 4 -- this includes dinner, equipment rentals, a free tutorial for beginners, and lots of prizes! We highly encourage everyone to sign up early, since there are a limited number of teams in the roster.

Registration is open at the Computer Engineering Club (ETL E2-040M)!

### 7. Startup Edmonton Weekly Hack Night

Startup Edmonton is hosting a weekly hack night for developers who want to code and collaborate for a few hours after school / work. It's a great opportunity to work alongside other developers who can help you out if you are stuck on a problem. Bring your own project or work with someone else. Developers of all experience levels are welcome!

Doors open around 6 pm and hacking continues until 9pm or so. All you need is a laptop and a project to work on.

### 8. New Logo...?

We're looking at changing our logo, and we want your help! We have some ideas at this point but nothing we can all agree on so we want your ideas too! If you have any sketches, Photoshop masterpieces or any other design that might work as our new logo send them our way, to Brittany at <internal@compeclub.com>. You have until October 15th to get your submissions in, so don't hesitate to send us your ideas!
