See you there!
IEEE AGM
Tuesday September 15th @ 5pm in ETLC 1-007

Wondering what being an IEEE member will do for you? Want access to the IEEE room on campus so you can use a fridge?
Come out the Annual General meeting to find out what kind of services IEEE can offer to undergrads while also finding out what the organization can offer you when you enter the engineering profession.

There will also be information on getting involved with the student branch if you are interested in volunteering but don't want to commit to a position that will take over your life.

There will be refreshments as well as free food at the event so be sure to mark it on your schedule.

This event is to encourage and allow those that are interested in technology to meet future employers.

Tickets are $10 and can be purchased on the second floor in front of the Business Students' Association Office from Sept 4 - Sept 24, or you can buy them at the door. See their [website](http://www.uofamis.com/events/connect-with-misc) for details.
Open Engineering GFC Positions
Nomination Deadline Monday, September 21

There are currently two General Faculties Council positions open for the upcoming by-election on October 1 and 2. The nomination deadline for the positions is Monday, September 21.

[The General Faculties Council](http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx)  consists of students and faculty representatives from across the University and deals with academic regulations. For example, the Academic Calendar is approved at GFC meetings.

Being a representative would make you a part of making essential decisions to the University and work with other students and faculty alike. You would help bring a student voice to this critical process and gain very valuable leadership experience. If you are interested in these positions, please see the attached document or read more [here](https://www.su.ualberta.ca/governance/elections/) ! ESS' own VP Services Sush Karunakaran and SU Councillor Thomas Patrick are both current GFC Representatives and I am sure they would both be more than willing to talk to you about it.
[ESS Google Calendar CALENDAR](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ualberta.ca_d12op0t596h4pm0nn5kekjejh4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Edmonton)

The ESS has created a public google calendar that will show all their events as well all discipline club events. We will be posting all of our events to this calendar so please check it out [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ualberta.ca_d12op0t596h4pm0nn5kekjejh4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Edmonton) to keep up to date with all your CompE events and Socials.
Engineering Employment Centre Mailing List

The Engineering Employment Centre has a mailing list with weekly emails detailing job postings that are closing each week in PlacePro. This is particularly useful to students in their final year of study who are looking for jobs. Companies are recruiting soon-to-be new grads now and throughout the coming months, so it's a good idea to monitor the postings so you don't miss anything. You can subscribe to their mailing list [here](http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/en/MailingLists.aspx) .
