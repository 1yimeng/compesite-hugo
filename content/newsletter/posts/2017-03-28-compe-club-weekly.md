### 7. GCTools Hackathon

The GCTools is the suite of applications for digital collaboration between departments of the Government of Canada (GC). The main tools are GCpedia (based on MediaWiki) and GCconnex (based on Elgg). GCconnex is the internal GC social network. GCcollab was recently put online for collaboration between the federal and provincial / territorial civil service and Canadian colleges / universities. GCcollab is a platform for collaboration with members of the public service (and other organizations) and also to find employment opportunities.  Teachers and students can register here (http://consultations.tbs-sct.gc.ca/s/gctools-reg-ins-outilsgc/?l=en) .
https://gccollab.ca/

All code and development is available on Github. This is the code that will be used for the hackathon. Most of the activity is on GCconnex, but all changes are being integrated into GCcollab and vice versa.
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gccollab
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcconnex
https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcpedia

The GCTools Hackathon will be on April 6-7, 2017 at the Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Service Lab in Ottawa.  You can participate virtually.  The goal is that diverse teams participate in improving the GCTools. There will be already identified issues and tasks as well as the possibility of proposing new functionality. In addition, the following challenges were identified as areas where we want to improve the GCTools::
* Accessibility
* User friendliness and experience
* Collaboration with open source software communities

The website can be found here (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/campaigns/gctools-hackathon.html) .

Also, a virtual workshop will be held on March 22, 2017 at 1 p.m. EST. to give participants an overview of the GCTools and a chance to ask questions, such as:
* What is the hackathon all about?
* What are the GCTools?
+ GCconnex, GCpedia, Gccollab, etc.
* What is open source software?
* What open source software is used in the Government of Canada?
* Next Steps

### 9. Amazon Job Opportunity

### 10. Masters/PhD in Montreal


Dr. Giovanni Beltrame, from MIST Lab at Ecole Polytechnique, is really aiming to get some more Canadian Masters and PhD students on his Robotics research team (CompEs, CompSci, and EEs mainly). He would prefer PhD students if possible, but is totally open to Masters students.

At Ecole Polytechnique, Masters & PhD classes are in English. So it doesn't matter if students do not know French while living in Montreal - you can totally get by knowing 0 French. Montreal was also recently rated the best student city in the world. So you can have a lot of fun year round!

Anyways, people are encouraged to direct any questions to:
bangotti@ualberta.ca
The deadline for applications is in May for Canadian Students. I think International Student deadlines may have passed already. It’s a great opportunity to work with a fantastic team and research a lot into autonomous robotics and swarm behaviours.

### 11. EEC Corner

To help you succeed in your job hunt, the Engineering Employment Centre (EEC) offers a variety of free workshops (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/WorkshopsEvents/Workshop%20Schedule.aspx) on topics such as resume and cover letter writing, interview preparation, effective use of LinkedIn, and job search strategies. You can also book a one-on-one appointment (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/WorkshopsEvents.aspx) with an EEC Employment Coordinator to review your resume and cover letter, practice your interview skills, or develop a job search strategy. If you’d like to access our tip sheets and handouts, stop by the office or view them on the EEC Resource Vault (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/StudentAndAlumniServices.aspx) .

We also suggest subscribing to our weekly newsletter (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/MailingLists.aspx) .  It’s filled with information about upcoming workshops and events, job posting deadlines, and other employment news. Helpful Hint: If you haven’t already done so, be sure to update your PlacePro job search preferences to “Employment / All / 2017” so that you’re able to view opportunities targeted to you.
If you have a question, we would love to hear from you!
