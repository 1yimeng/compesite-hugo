### 1. HackED Beta UPDATE


Registration for HackED this fall has officially closed. We sold out on Thursday last week, and if you registered via the waiting list you may or may not have gotten one of the extra spots. Unfortunately there's only so much room at events like these, so we apologize to anyone who wanted to attend but couldn't get in. That being said, we appreciate everyone who registered, and we're excited to see you all at Startup Edmonton on the 18th! We hope you have a good November break!

Also, if you were registered through the waiting list, don't forget to pay the $5 fee before November 11 (This Friday). Thanks!

If you were not able to register for HackED Beta, tune in for another hackathon happening in January. YES! ANOTHER HACKATHON! HackED 2018 will be even bigger, and even more competitive.

### 4. Edmonton Code Retreat

On Saturday, November 25th, we'd love to see Comp. Eng. students attend Edmonton Coderetreat! Coderetreat exposes you to new challenges and flexes your problem-solving skills in a test-driven, pair-programming environment. The event is being held downtown at DevFacto (</br>
#2250, Scotia Place Tower 1, 10060 Jasper Avenue NW) on November 25th from 9AM-5PM.  We will provide lunch and drinks (please note any food allergies/preferences when registering) free of charge, we only ask that you bring a laptop with your favourite code editor.  There are no restrictions on languages used, nor is there a minimum skill requirement: we believe everyone who programs can learn something new by attending a Coderetreat.

Be sure to register yourself and anyone else tagging long at our EventBrite page: https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/edmonton-coderetreat-registration-37315716312


### 5. Hack Time

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1 - 008

Hey Guys! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Student's can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
