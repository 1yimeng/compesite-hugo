### 2. Winter AGM

Our Winter AGM will be taking place on February 11th at 5pm in ATCO Design Lab. There will be PIZZA, as usual and we will be hearing Campaign Speeches for next year's executive. We will also be discussing next year's Geer Week theme. We currently have so many ideas we are going to have to cut down the list before AGM. Some of the ideas include Hack To The Future, The Hex Files, My Big Fat Compiler Warning, Kernel Space Program, and more.
This is also an opportunity for first years to see how the Computer Engineering Club operates and as such are welcome at the meeting.
