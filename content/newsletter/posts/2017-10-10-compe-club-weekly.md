### 2. Communitech Code / Design to Win

Want to make $5,000 in one day, legally?

Code/Design to Win is exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards. If youâ€™re a student who loves computer science, programming or product design and attend one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you.
To register for the event, and for more information click here. (https://www.communitech.ca/how-we-help/talent/code-to-win/)

### 4. Hack Time

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1 - 008

Hey Guys! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Student's can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
