### Election Results


After that gruelling 2-week campaign season, I'm sure we're all relieved to see another successful election cycle behind us. Congratulations to those who won! Don't be discouraged if you didn't - you'll be more than welcome to run as a junior exec in the fall. The peaceful transition of power will last until the end of the semester, when the new executive-elects will ascend to their thrones of Comp E Club executivehood. In the meantime, be sure to check out some of the fun events coming in the next few weeks.

You can also book a one-on-one appointment (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/WorkshopsEvents.aspx) with an EEC Employment Coordinator to review your resume and cover letter, practice your interview skills, or develop a job search strategy. If you’d like to access our tip sheets and handouts, stop by the office or view them on the EEC Resource Vault (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/StudentAndAlumniServices.aspx) .
