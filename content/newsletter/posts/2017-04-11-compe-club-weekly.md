### The End


With the last day of classes tomorrow, the semester is effectively over. The bad news is that our weekly newsletter will only be sent out once in a while over the spring and summer terms before returning in the fall. Hopefully, the end of projects and finals for a few months helps make up for this tragic news. Check out the last events of the semester. Good luck on finals, have a great summer, and see you again in fall! (unless you're graduating)

In this issue:
1. Hack Time - Show Off Your Final Projects
2. Hackathon Committee
3. LAN Party
4. March for Science
5. Startup Edmonton
6. Bioinformatics Summer School
7. Masters/PhD in Montreal
8. Canadian Undergraduate Computer Science Conference
9. EEC Corner

</br>

### 1. Hack Time - Show Off Your Final Projects

**When:** Right now!
**Where:** ATCO Design Lab, ETLC

Come on out to the last Hack Time of the semester! If you have any cool projects you want to demo, want to see anyone else's projects, or just want to come work on homework/projects then come on down!

</br>

### 2. Hackathon Committee


We’re forming a committee to help organize both our hackathons next year! If you’re interested in helping HackEd continue to grow, apply for a position on the committee. Descriptions of each position can be found in the application form.

Check out the video from our previous hackathon: HackEd 2017 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNISKUC5bew)

You can apply here (https://goo.gl/forms/22zvRvifkUxDU5Ei2) .

### 3. LAN Party


**When:** April 13 - 14, 12pm - 12pm (24 hour event!)
**Where:** CSC Building, main floor

Comp Sci has a tradition of holding a LAN party at the end of the semester and it's about that time of year again! This year it shall be on April 13th-14th (Thursday - Friday). (It's on the weekdays due to the Easter weekend.) The year-end LAN party is always a fun time and is a great time to relax after completing the semester before exams start up.

They are asking if anyone has any game requests. If you have a good one that you would like to see at the party, please email vpjuniorrep@uacs.ca (mailto:vpjuniorrep@uacs.ca) .

### 4. March for Science


**When:** 1:00 - 2:00 pm on Saturday, April 22, 2017.
**Where:** Alberta Legislature Building

We live in interesting times. In the US, the latest budget proposal slashes funding for environmental protections, medical research, space exploration, and the arts. At home, Canadian researchers know all too well the pains of government restrictions on communicating with the public, records annihilation, and starvation of basic research.

In response to this climate, over 350 rallies in support of science, research, and evidence-based policy are being planned under the bannerMarch for Science (https://www.marchforscience.com/) .

Scientists, educators, policy makers, and community members will band together to stand up for science and evidence-based policy. A growing number of researchers and individuals who value science are making it clear that silence is a luxury we can no longer afford. The stakes are high and we have a moral responsibility to speak out. Science, in all of its many forms, plays a vital role in our lives and in our democracy, but the relationship between science and democracy is under threat. We need real facts - not alternative ones - to make effective decisions. And we need scientific theories - not conspiracy theories - to make sense of our world.

This is going to be the largest international public demonstration in support of science, ever, and we want Edmonton to be part of it with a strong showing of support.

For more information on the March for Science please see our website (sciencemarchyeg.ca (https://sciencemarchyeg.ca/) ), Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ScienceMarchYeg/) and Twitter feed (@ScienceMarchYEG).

### 5. Startup Edmonton


If you'll be in Edmonton over the summer months and have some free time, be sure to check out the various events and resources at Startup Edmonton (http://startupedmonton.squarespace.com/) . They have tons of free events (http://startupedmonton.squarespace.com/events-overview/)  that that can get you connected with people and companies that have shared interests in technology. This is a really great way to grow your skills and expand your circle.

Post-secondary students can get a free Student Commons Membership (http://startupedmonton.squarespace.com/students/)  that gives them $25 off a workshop of your choice, invitations to Commons Socials (like Member Coffee, Startup Ski Trip and more), and a membership card for discounts and offers at our friends like Mercer Tavern, Pogo CarShare, and Fitset.

### 6. Bioinformatics Summer School - University of Angers - France

**When:** June 26 - July 7
**Where:** University of Angers, France

The University of Angers and the University of Nantes, France have organized a summer school called BIOINFORMATICS, which will take place from June 26th to July 7th 2017.

This interactive program includes lectures, workshops, projects and visits entirely taught in English by renowned researchers.

It aims at bringing students the ability to conduct biological studies from big data analysis to extract relevant biomarkers to large scale models engineering in order to enhance biological production.

The €750 registration cost for 2 weeks covers tuition, accommodation, lunches (during the week), scheduled excursions and welcome service (pick-up from the train station, welcome barbecue, extracurricular activities, etc). 6 "ECTS credits" will be delivered at the end of the program.

Application deadline: 15th April 2017.

For more information, registration and video of the previous edition, please visit our website: Bioinformatics (http://summerschools.univ-angers.fr/en/index/about-schools/schools/bioinformatics.html)

Angers summer schools are intensive experiences which bring together young people and experts from all over the world. Come to France share your passion for science!

### 7. Masters/PhD in Montreal


Dr. Giovanni Beltrame, from MIST Lab at Ecole Polytechnique, is really aiming to get some more Canadian Masters and PhD students on his Robotics research team (CompEs, CompSci, and EEs mainly). He would prefer PhD students if possible, but is totally open to Masters students.

At Ecole Polytechnique, Masters & PhD classes are in English. So it doesn't matter if students do not know French while living in Montreal - you can totally get by knowing 0 French. Montreal was also recently rated the best student city in the world. So you can have a lot of fun year round!

Anyways, people are encouraged to direct any questions to:
bangotti@ualberta.ca
The deadline for applications is in May for Canadian Students. I think International Student deadlines may have passed already. It’s a great opportunity to work with a fantastic team and research a lot into autonomous robotics and swarm behaviours.

### 8. Canadian Undergraduate Computer Science Conference


**When:** June 15-17
**Where:** University of Toronto

Held this year at the University of Toronto (UofT), this conference will be showcasing cutting edge research in computer science from both academia and industry; as well as connecting the two through an exclusive career fair.

Find more information here (http://www.cucsc.ca/en/about) .

### 9. EEC Corner

To help you succeed in your job hunt, the Engineering Employment Centre (EEC) offers a variety of free workshops (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/WorkshopsEvents/Workshop%20Schedule.aspx) on topics such as resume and cover letter writing, interview preparation, effective use of LinkedIn, and job search strategies. You can also book a one-on-one appointment (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/WorkshopsEvents.aspx) with an EEC Employment Coordinator to review your resume and cover letter, practice your interview skills, or develop a job search strategy. If you’d like to access our tip sheets and handouts, stop by the office or view them on the EEC Resource Vault (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/StudentAndAlumniServices.aspx) .

We also suggest subscribing to our weekly newsletter (http://www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca/MailingLists.aspx) .  It’s filled with information about upcoming workshops and events, job posting deadlines, and other employment news. Helpful Hint: If you haven’t already done so, be sure to update your PlacePro job search preferences to “Employment / All / 2017” so that you’re able to view opportunities targeted to you.
If you have a question, we would love to hear from you!
