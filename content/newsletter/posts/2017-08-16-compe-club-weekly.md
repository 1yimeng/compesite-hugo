### Edmonton Tech Company is Seeking Ground-Level Technical Co-Founder from U of A

A tech startup based in Edmonton is seeking to onboard local talent from the University of Alberta as a technical co-founder. The company is North American Parts Dealer Exchange (NADPE), who provides a virtual marketplace for dealerships to liquidate or trade out-of-date parts inventory.  A $2.1 Billion dollar problem that plagues every new car dealership with no current equitable solution. Currently, more than 100 dealerships across North America have enrolled, with multiple transactions occurring every day.

Due to their rapid growth, NADPE Chief Executive Officer Shawn Larkin is reaching out to the University of Alberta with an opportunity. “At NADPE, we’ve quickly developed a strong foundation of dealers who want to use our service. I’d absolutely love to keep our success in the hands of local, hardworking, people, so I’m searching for a 4th or 5th-year Computer Engineering University student or alumni. To start, the part-time position won’t be a typical employee at NADPE – instead, the candidate selected for this foundational position will be offered shares in the company - NADPE.”

Larkin said, “It is an excellent opportunity for a brilliant mind to get their start in the innovative world of technology, showcase their skills, and grow with an exciting company.”

### Moving from Outsourced to Homegrown


Currently, NADPE is outsourcing development to a 3rd-party US programming company. While the current platform is complete, coded with PHP and MySQL, there’s already come a time, just six months into existence, that the platform needs to be updated and expanded.

Larkin hopes the highly-acclaimed programs at the University of Alberta will produce the talent necessary to propel NADPE forward. “Our industry-leading, and industry-first, parts platform is already doing better than imagined. Finding the right person to add to our team as a technical co-founder has the ability to move NADPE from a modest Canadian startup to a well-known and highly profitable entity in the automotive parts marketplace.”

### More about NADPE


North American Dealer Parts Exchange began in Edmonton, AB in January of 2017. NADPE was born out of the frustrations of a Parts Director who was tired of having to scrap perfectly good parts that he simply could not sell or return. Trying to move them via channels like eBay™ was a non-starter – it would have taken way too much time and attention. He knew that there were other dealers out there somewhere who could use his parts, and they probably had parts that he could use that they didn’t need, but there was no way to find them.

He developed the idea of a parts trading/sales platform that could be used by Parts Managers across North America, recruited an experienced NADA-trained management team from various auto dealerships, and created NADPE. Coupling his experience as a Parts Director for multiple dealerships with the experience of his team in finance, management, customer support and customer service, they created a new, cost-effective approach to dealing with dead and idle parts. Four years later, and over $700,000 in seed funding, NADPE was launched. With a full management team in place, investors and a sales team, it got off the ground running. Six months down the road, they have over 100 Dealerships signed up including the largest Canadian Auto Group, and are conducting multiple exchanges per day.
