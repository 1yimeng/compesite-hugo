    ### Happy Geer Week!


This week is the 75th year of Geer Week, the week-long competition between engineering disciplines! Since the start of Geer Week this last Saturday, CompEs have had a ton of fun participating in the tech display, the dodgeball tournament, the tug of war and the scavenger hunt. Don't worry if you haven't been able to make it out to any of these events, there are still a bunch more that we encourage you all to attend and participate in. See the full schedule of events [here ](https://docs.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/spreadsheets/d/16gqVOwBg6DhvsoeCQOnLB6T80bY3P1FXX-deCMNn7lc/edit?usp=sharing) .

To add to the excitement, next week is ECE Week, a week-long event that connects Electrical, Computer, and Engineering Physics students with industry. It will all culminate in the HackEd Hackathon on January 28th. Have fun these next couple weeks!

### 2. Weekly Coding Event Interest Survey


We are trying to coordinate social coding events for Comp E starting this year. We're sending out a survey to gauge interest.

The plan is to book a room on a weekly basis where people can go to work on personal projects and get mentorship from later year students. Also we wanted to eventually have people do small guided sessions where they do a tutorial on a language/library/project that they know or are working on.

Please fill out this [survey ](https://compeclub1.typeform.com/to/lneGSx) to provide feedback for this idea if you'd like to see this happen.

### 3. ECE Week 2017

January 23-27, 2017

It's here once again! January is for ECE Week!

CompE, EE, and EngPhys clubs present to you a week-long event where you get to interact with different companies in the tech industry as well as opportunities to learn through interactive workshops.

### 4. HackEd 2017

HackEd Fall turned out great last November. A number of beginners and non-beginners showed up and learned and worked with mentors from different companies. As part of the annual ECE Week, we are having another hackathon - HackEd 2017. It's bigger, better and more competitive!

This time it's a [Major League Hacking ](https://mlh.io/)  event.

Our goal is to bring together motivated students from diverse, interdisciplinary backgrounds and challenge them to build something awesome in a collaborative and competitive environment.

This year's hackathon will be on January 28 - 29 at Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 104 St Mercer Warehouse).

### 5. Startup Edmonton Democamp 34

**When:** Tuesday, January 24 at 6:30 pm
**Where:** CCIS 1-140, University of Alberta

DemoCamp brings together developers, creatives, entrepreneurs and investors to share what they’ve been working on and to find others in the community interested in similar topics. For presenters, it’s a great way to get feedback on what you’re building from peers and the community, all in an informal setting. Started back in 2008, DemoCamp Edmonton has steadily grown into one of the largest in the country, with over 200 people attending each event.

The rules for DemoCamp are simple: 7 minutes to demo real, working products, followed by a few minutes for questions, and no slides allowed.

Drinks and networking to follow at RATT (Room At The Top) - 7th floor of the Students Union Building

Hashtag is #democampyeg

RSVP [here](http://www.startupedmonton.com/democamp/?mc_cid=328b856516&mc_eid=a906efb9d8) .


### 6. Hemi Thaker: How We Built A Multi-Million Dollar Tech Company
**When:** 4:30 pm Thursday January 26, 2017, a light reception to follow
**Where:** 8th Floor, Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering


As part of ECE week, please read below, feel free to share with other students in Engineering.
The Faculty of Engineering partnered with the Alberta School of Business present the Cheriton Distinguished Lecture Series featuring Hemi Thaker.

Hemi is a University of Alberta alum, graduating from the Computer Engineering program in '86, and a very successful business entrepreneur. He earned his Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo and has launched two winning companies with very little start-up money. As the winner of the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award he hopes to inspire Canadians to take risks in their careers. He has had successes and what he calls successful failures over the years and with his vast life experience this proves to be a stimulating lecture for both Engineers and business enthusiasts.

### 10. DiscoverE Girls Coding Club: Female Volunteers Needed

Girls Coding Club and GEM (Girls Engineering and Mentorship) are day camps run on Saturdays throughout the semester for young girls in grade 3 to 5 and 6 to 9.

These camps help to promote the sciences to young girls and of course to work these clubs volunteers are needed! Specifically female volunteers to show just how cool and possible it is to be Girl in the sciences!

The time commitment is either just your Saturday morning or afternoon, once a week from January to April. It's a great way to inspire the next generation and build up your resume with volunteer work!

### 11. Volunteer Opportunity: CHOICES Conference 2017

Greetings from WISEST!

We would like to invite you to consider volunteering for WISEST's upcoming CHOICES Conference for Grade 6 girls, scheduled to take place over Reading Week on February 21 & 22, 2017.

Our CHOICES Conference will bring 300 girls to the U of A on both Feb. 21 & 22 (for a total of 600 students!). Our goal is to get these young women excited about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through hands-on, fun, and engaging activities.  These activities would not be possible without the tremendous support that we receive from our volunteers.

We are currently looking for individuals to fill the following roles:

Science Activity Leaders -  Undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, lab coordinators, and professionals can all volunteer to lead or assist with a lab activity related to their field of interest.  We generally ask volunteers to commit to delivering their activity twice on each day of the conference but can possibly take volunteers who can only commit to one day. We are open to hearing your ideas for new activities or can suggest some tried and tested activities from previous CHOICES Conferences!

[SIGN UP HERE! ](https://goo.gl/forms/wjUgbZ8Mg98CmPpx2)

Campus Ambassadors and General Volunteers - Undergraduates, graduate or PhD students, and high school students are all welcome to consider either of these volunteer roles. Campus Ambassadors help to guide students around campus while General Volunteers assist with event logistics like set up, registration, signage, clean up, etc.

[SIGN UP HERE!  ](https://goo.gl/forms/4gaJvsDIY0Qkl07h1)

For additional details, please visit the WISEST [website ](http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/Programs/ChoicesConference/VolunteerforChoices) . (http://www.wisest.ualberta.ca/Programs/ChoicesConference/VolunteerforChoices)

All volunteers who sign up will be contacted to confirm their participation and to provide further details via the email addresses submitted. We hope that you consider helping WISEST for this amazing event and we are happy to answer any additional questions that you have - just email us at [wisest@ualberta.ca ](mailto:wisest@ualberta.ca) .
