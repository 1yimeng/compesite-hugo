2. 2017/18 CompE Club Elections
3. Google’s February YouTube Live Event Opportunities

### 9. LEED Green Associate Training

**When:** March 4^th 2017 – 12:00PM to 5:00 PM
**Where:** University of Alberta – ECHA – Room 1-182 - https://goo.gl/maps/uT5Lh
Registration: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/

Interested in getting involved in the Green Building and sustainability Industry? Opportunities are plentiful and passing your LEED professional designation is required to get involved!

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a green-rating point system to certify a building’s sustainability. Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, students and professional can become LEED Accredited themselves.  The LEED Green Associate (GA) credential is the only professional designation used to market yourself to employers and clients and show you have certified knowledge in the green building industry.

To date, this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping over 7000 students pass their exam at a 100% pass rate and does not require any specific background. This course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their name and it never expires!

Also, a new LEED rating system (v4) was introduced this year and this training course is one of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system to ensure your knowledge is up to date! This course meets the exam’s eligibility requirements and the USGBC charges a $100 (reduced for students) fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time at your nearest Prometric center.

Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)
To register for the class please visit: http://leadinggreen.ca/edmonton/
