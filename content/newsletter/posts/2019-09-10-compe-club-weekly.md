Hello All! It's a new semester, and it's time to get back into the grind. We hope you have a great semester ahead of you. The first few weeks of classes are some of the best. Midterms and finals are a distant threat not worth thinking about, and many classes are in that lull of review and introductory material. In this relative time of peace, we hope you take advantage of the numerous events being held around campus, or at least the free pizza. If you need some help picking events to go to, why not attend the events below?

You can also fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments.

Join us for a fun, fast-paced, hands-on workshop on Wednesday, September 18th from 5:30pm to 8:30pm at Jobber HQ. We'll break into sprint teams consisting of a wide range of skills, and learn how to do Google's original sprint process. Each team will select a sample business problem, break it down, sketch solutions, and decide which ideas to test with people from other teams. We'll learn how to spark innovation and launch proven solutions faster with Google Design Sprints.
