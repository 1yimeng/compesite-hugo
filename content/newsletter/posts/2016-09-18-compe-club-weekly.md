### 2. eHUB SPARK Event


**When:** 20^th September 2016, 5:00 - 7:30 p.m.
**Where:** CCIS L1-430

eHUB is recruiting future entrepreneurs! They help eHUB members with exploring and evolving their ideas into working businesses. eHUB does this by providing funding, providing one-on-one mentorship, reviewing business and marketing materials, connecting teams with skilled interns/co-founders. Perhaps you have an idea that you would like to explore but you donâ€™t know how to go about it? Or perhaps you have a specific skill set that is sought by one of their current or future start-ups and you believe that you can help them to become successful?

If entrepreneurship is something that you might be interested in, we encourage you to come to the eHUB SPARK event on September 20^th. The main event takes place from 5:00 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. and is located in CCIS L1-430. If you submitted a pitch and were not selected for SPARK, feel free to attend the PRESPARK event that will take place in eHUB (HUB Mall 9007) at 3PM. There will be free snacks and some speed networking with the group.

The first 10 students to email [ehub@ualberta.ca ](mailto:ehub@ualberta.ca)  get free tickets. Otherwise, tickets can be bought for $8. Please purchase tickets via the following link
