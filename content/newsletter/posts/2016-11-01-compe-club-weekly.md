### 1. How to CompE


"How to CompE" is a series of workshops designed to teach Computer Engineers how to navigate the unique job market in the technology sector. Engg 100 and 101 taught you the basics, now tailor your skills to get the career you want in technology.

The first workshop, Strategies for Finding Your Dream Job, is happening from 5-7pm tonight in ETLC E1-013.

See more information and RSVP [here ](https://howtocompeworkshops2016.eventbrite.ca/) .

### 2. FREE Digital Security Sessions by Panda Rose

**When:** Thursday at 5pm
**Where:** MecE 2-3

The CTO of Panda Rose Consulting Studios Inc has generously decided to give 4 free lectures on digital security. The topics covered are as follows:
* Talk 1: Digital Security
* Talk 2: Privacy and Encryption
* Talk 3: Authentication and Non-Repudiation
* Talk 4: Putting it all together

This week is the fourth and final talk. It will bring together skills learned in the previous talks to build a simple digital system for sending secure data between 2 parties. Audience participation is required. After making this simple system, you will be shown some penetration testing techniques that already exist and, if time permits, a card game created by Microsoft that helps teams find unusual angles of attack in their environments.

### 3. HackEd Fall: A 24-hour hackathon by the Computer Engineering Club
**When:** November 12-13
**Where:** Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 - 104 Street | Mercer Warehouse |  Edmonton, Alberta)
Registration Fee: $10

Hackathons are for hacking: creating and collaborating on software and hardware projects.

HackEd Fall aims to get beginners hacking!

Checkout what we're providing to help get you started:
* Tips and Tricks presentation before the hackathon starts! Ben Zittlau from Jobber has loads of hackathon experience and will help you get some of the beginner's dust off.
* The three participating companies (Jobber, DriveWyze, Gfycat) will be presenting their product/platform and an overview of their API. They will also provide sample ideas on what to build using their API.
* Student and industry mentors during the hackathon! The participating companies and upper year student volunteers will be around to help you and your team with bugs and road blocks that you run into

Still need more incentive, how about PRIZES? Win prizes from Jobber, DriveWyze and Gfycat by incorporating their API's into your project. They'll be around to help you as mentors!

### 5. Quantum Computing Undergraduate Research Opportunities


The Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) would like to share the following information with students:

</br>

### Be a part of world-class research this summer


</br>

### Learn about quantum information processing and gain research experience


At the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) we have a couple of different learning opportunities available for undergraduate students interested in quantum information processing.

Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) - May 29-June 9
Start the summer with a two-week [introduction ](http://uwaterloo.us7.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=88e2f2b6c4505da990964a890&id=af689bc259&e=45a0d44603)  to the theoretical and experimental study of quantum information processing which includes 30 hours in the labs. You will get the opportunity to interact with students from around world, work with graduate students, postdocs and IQC faculty. This program is fully funded – including your accommodations and food. You can also apply for travel bursaries.
Watch this quick [video ](http://uwaterloo.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=88e2f2b6c4505da990964a890&id=adf610423b&e=45a0d44603)  to get a feel for the full experience.

Undergraduate Research Award - all summer
Join us at IQC for the summer through an [Undergraduate Research Award ](http://uwaterloo.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=88e2f2b6c4505da990964a890&id=5ae96af1b4&e=45a0d44603)  and work with one of our researchers – experimentalist or theorist. Not only will you enhance your research experience and prepare for your graduate studies and research career, but you get the chance to attend IQC seminars, lectures, and student talks. This is a unique opportunity to interact with an interdisciplinary research community.

Apply before January 9!
You can choose to only apply to attend USEQIP, to only apply for an Undergraduate Research Award, or apply for both.
* If you want to apply to both, complete the [USEQIP application ](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/useqip-2017/)  and check the appropriate box for the Undergraduate Research Award.*
* If you only want to apply for USEQIP, complete the[ USEQIP application ](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/useqip-2017/)  but do NOT check the box for the Undergraduate Research Award.
* If you only want to apply for the Undergraduate Research Award, complete the [URA application ](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/undergraduate-student-internship-2017/) .

*In the event that you are not invited to USEQIP, you will still be considered for an Undergraduate Research Award as we have more URA opportunities than spots in USEQIP.

### 6. Meet A Computer Engineer Panel Recap


Ever wonder what it's like being a Computer Engineer but were too busy to attend last week's Meet A Computer Engineer Panel?

Well you're in luck because one of our VP Externals recorded the main talking points and summarized them [here ](https://docs.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/document/d/1nifPbcvoqMnpnIhpjTJHpx0KQOxb-O8QGQ5HrXJnViU/edit?usp=sharing) .

(For those of you who don't know, Meet A Computer Engineer is an event in which a panel of industry professionals and computer engineering alumni share with students their experiences in the work force as well as their time as an undergraduate.)
