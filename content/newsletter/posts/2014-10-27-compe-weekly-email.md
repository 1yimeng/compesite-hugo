### 2. Solder Workshop

We are working with the Edmonton New Technology Society to have some soldering workshops for students to learn to solder or improve their existing skills. The project and date will be decided on soon. Please email Andrew at [social@compeclub.com](mailto:social@compeclub.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20in%20Soldering!)  if you're interested - we would like a rough estimate, so please email even if you have nothing to say.
