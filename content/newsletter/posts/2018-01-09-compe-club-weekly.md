### 8. HackTime

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1-008

Hey everyone! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Students can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
