### The Pod

**Who:** Student innovators who want a modern space to create.
**When:** Week of Welcome
**What:** Week of Welcome is featuring a space for services offered to the more entrepreneurial students. The Pod is a trove of useful resources for students who want to turn an idea into a product. Expert guidance is provided from mentors who have gone through the process many times. The pod is a space for creating and collaborating to get your ideas out to the world.  Spaces like The Shack, The Elko Engineering Garage, and SIC also provide students with the tools to build and prototype ideas.
If any of this sounded interesting, be sure to check out their table at the Week of Welcome! If not for the amazing opportunities they offer, at least go for the free swag.
