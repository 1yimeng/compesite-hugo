Even better, you can create something that has not physically existed. It is the flexibility and power of computing, expressed in physical, tangible form.
Everyone is welcome, there will be presentations for projects of every skill level, and there will likely be food provided!

### 5)  Merchandise Ideas

**WHERE:** [Here ](https://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com/en/)
**WHAT:** Misinformation is rampant no matter where you look on the internet. Fact checkers and reputable news sources were a sufficient solution to keep well informed in the past, but this wave of fake news challenges that tradition. The Schulich Foundation invites you to tackle this problem with AI. Groups of up to 5 people are tasked with creating an AI that can evaluate the validity of the statement, and if possible, provide evidence. The winning team will claim the $1 milllion prize! This is a great experience to undertake. The competition is far off now, but it definatly worth your consideration!
