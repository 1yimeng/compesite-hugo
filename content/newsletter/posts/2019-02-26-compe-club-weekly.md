### 5) Heal Yo' Feels:



**WHO:** Anyone wanting to learn about coping mechanisms
**WHERE:** ETLC Solarium
**WHEN:** Thursday, February 28th @ 5:30PM to 8:00PM
**WHAT:** The Fentanil Project and Diversity in Engineering are holding a collaborative event focused on ameliorating how we—students and attendees—express our pain. This will be a panel event and information session.

The intent of this event is to discuss common harmful coping mechanisms—providing information on harm-reduction practices for unhealthy behaviours, and presenting alternative forms of stress and emotional management.

We aim to inform attendees on the effects of the opioid crisis and provide information of reducing harm resulting from drug use, including naloxone training. This event will address the topic of prevalence of substance abuse and self-harm, discuss why this topic is relevant to all individuals in our communities (not just users), and present alternative forms of coping mechanisms.

Take-home naloxone kits will be distributed to those who participate in the training. Refreshments will be provided to all attendees.

The event is free and anybody is welcome to attend. Donations will be accepted at the door.

### 7) Breaking Barriers: Jobber JUMP



**WHO:** Anyone in interested in workplace incusivity
**WHERE:** Jobber HQ - 4th floor, 10520 Jasper Avenue
**WHEN:** Wednesday, March 6th @ 5:30PM to 8:30PM
**WHAT:**When you look around your classroom, do you notice a lack of diversity?Chances are, you’ll notice a higher proportion of men who are attending classes for anything science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) related. According to a McKinsey & Company Canada report released in 2016, women only make up 28% of STEM graduates and 23% of people employed in STEM. These percentages decrease if you start bringing in other diversity factors, such as other cultures, sexual orientation, or beliefs.

While programs are being created to start increasing diversity in these industries, there also needs to be an environment created within the workplace where people feel like the can grow their career, experience success, and ultimately feel as if they belong.

At this event, we'll tackle questions about the importance of an inclusive working environment, what they’re doing to challenge the stereotype of working in technology, and the importance of creating advocates and building awareness about bias.
