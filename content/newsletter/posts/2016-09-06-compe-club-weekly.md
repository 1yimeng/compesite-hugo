3. THE RETURN OF GEER WEEK!

Yes, you heard us right! Geer week will be making it's comeback on January!
If you do not know what Geer week is, it's an ESS event where all discipline clubs compete against each other in a series of events where only one club will reign victorious!

It is the 75th Geer Week, so it's going to be a Hunger Games quarter-quell themed event.

CompE Club are the defending champions from the last Geer week (2015).
