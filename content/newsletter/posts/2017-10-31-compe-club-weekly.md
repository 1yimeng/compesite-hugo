### 1. Edmonton Code Retreat

On Saturday, November 25th, we'd love to see Comp. Eng. students attend Edmonton Coderetreat! Coderetreat exposes you to new challenges and flexes your problem-solving skills in a test-driven, pair-programming environment. The event is being held downtown at DevFacto (</br>
#2250, Scotia Place Tower 1, 10060 Jasper Avenue NW) on November 25th from 9AM-5PM.  We will provide lunch and drinks (please note any food allergies/preferences when registering) free of charge, we only ask that you bring a laptop with your favourite code editor.  There are no restrictions on languages used, nor is there a minimum skill requirement: we believe everyone who programs can learn something new by attending a Coderetreat.

Be sure to register yourself and anyone else tagging long at our EventBrite page: https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/edmonton-coderetreat-registration-37315716312

Whether or not you have programmed before does not matter, we want you here regardless of your experience!

The event features mentors from cool startups around Edmonton, tech and beginner workshops to help you learn, food, prizes, and swag.

### 3. Microsoft at UAlberta


Hello UAlberta! Our names are Monica Bui and Sarah Hoven and we are your new Microsoft Student Partners at UofA.

What this means is that we will be a liaison between the Microsoft community and the University. With the support of Microsoft, we plan to host workshops and events to provide opportunities for our students to learn and explore new technologies. This role allows us to make our university more visible with not just Microsoft but the tech community itself!

Please like and follow our Facebook (facebook.com/mspualberta) and Twitter (@mspualberta) accounts to stay updated on future info. Our main email is mspualberta@outlook.com (mailto:mspualberta@outlook.com)  if you wish to contact us.


Thank you UofA and we hope to make this year awesome!

### 4. Hack Time

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1 - 008

Hey Guys! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Student's can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
