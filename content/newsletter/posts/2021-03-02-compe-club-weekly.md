Welcome to the seventh week of school! March started which means half of the semester has passed. I believe you guys will be able to get through the rest of the semester as well! Here is some interesting event for you!
<br/>

### Highlights:
* **ECE First Year Night**
<br/>

### 1)  **ECE First Year Night**

**WHO:** All first years interested in ECE Disciplines

**WHEN:**  Wednesday, March 10th, 5:00pm - 6:00pm

**WHERE:** Zoom meeting (Link to be announced)

**WHAT:** 

ECE First Year night is coming. If you're in your first year
and you're having doubts about what discipline to pick, this is the event for you!
If you're not in the first year, be sure to let all your first-year friends know.
This will be an hour-long panel where panelists will
discuss what one can expect from each ECE discipline.
Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions about what it's like
being in one of the top 3 Engineering disciplines. Everything from course content
to career advice, with sessions for 1 on 1 Q&A if you're so inclined.
We hope to see you there.
