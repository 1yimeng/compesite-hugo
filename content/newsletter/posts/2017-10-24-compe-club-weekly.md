### 2. University of Alberta Engineering Competition: Coding

**When:** October 29, 8:30 am - 5:30 pm

The ESS is hosting the annual University of Alberta Engineering Competition (UAEC) on Oct 29th, from 8:30 am - 5:30 pm. The winner of the programming competition gets an almost fully subsidized trip to the Western Engineering Competition in Burnaby, BC, and this is a great way for students to practice their coding skills in a fun environment. Interested students can sign up at the GEER store- and I've also attached a link below to a google form.

Sign-up here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6fM88q0zB1B2oLYprr1NK_yaLrMoaex0KGO2VFAmgDWbDqA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### 3. Institute for Quantum Computing

Be a part of world-class research this summer!

Learn about quantum information processing and gain research experience
The Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) has learning opportunities available for undergraduate students interested in quantum information processing.

Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) - May 28-June 8, 2018
Start the summer with a two-week introduction (https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/programs/useqip)  to the theoretical and experimental study of quantum information processing which includes 30 hours of hands-on time in the labs. You will get the opportunity to interact with students from around the world, work with graduate students, postdocs and IQC faculty members. This program is fully funded – including your accommodations and food. You can also apply for travel bursaries.
Watch this quick video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HBtpJoiraY)  to get a feel for the full experience.

Undergraduate Research Award - all summer
Join us at IQC for the summer through an Undergraduate Research Award (https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/programs/ura)  and work with one of our researchers – an experimentalist or a theorist. Not only will you enhance your research experience and prepare for your graduate studies and research career, but you get the chance to attend IQC seminars, lectures, and student talks. This is a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in an interdisciplinary research community.

Apply before January 8!
You can choose to apply to attend only USEQIP, to apply only for an Undergraduate Research Award, or apply for both.
* If you want to apply to both (https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/useqip-2018/) , click the USEQIP button. Complete the application and check the appropriate box for the Undergraduate Research Award.*
* If you only want to apply for USEQIP (https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/useqip-2018/) , click the USEQIP button. Complete the application but do NOT check the box for the Undergraduate Research Award.
* If you only want to apply for the Undergraduate Research Award (https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/applications/positions/undergraduate-student-internship-201/) , click the URA button and complete the application.

*In the event that you are not invited to USEQIP, you will still be considered for an Undergraduate Research Award as we have more URA opportunities than spots in USEQIP.

Each year, about 120000 foreigners (students, professionals, and scholars) receive financial support from German funding organizations such as the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst), Alexander Von Humbolt Foundation (AvH), German Research Foundation (DFG), Max Planck Society (MPG), Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (FhG), researchers/scientists/professors at universities and research institutions across Germany. This seminar will first give a general overview of higher education and research in Germany, which is Europe's leading economy, and one of the world's leading nations in scientific research and technology. Then, information will be provided on the opportunity for students of North America (Canada and USA) to advance their academic career via study visits or seminars, summer courses, internships, or research projects at graduate schools of Germany, and supported through scholarships, fellowships, research grants or work contracts,
for durations ranging from several days to several years.

### 8. Hack Time

**When:** Mondays, 5 pm to 8 pm
**Where:** ETLC E1 - 008

Hey Guys! CompE Club is hosting a help and study session for students in computer engineering every Monday at 5 pm. We made this event specifically with second years in mind, since we know how jarring and difficult the first semester of second year can be to get used to. That being said, Hack Time is open to all computer engineering students and we would be more than happy to have you. Student's can ask for help on their studies and projects from those more experienced, or just use it as a space to study and talk to others. See you there!
