### HackED Registration Now Open!


**WHO:** Anyone and Everyone
**WHEN:** Saturday, 19, January @ 10:00am - Sunday, 20, January
**WHERE:** Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering
**WHAT:** HackED is Alberta's largest student run hackathon, and registration is now open! It's people of all levels of skill and experience. If you couldn't go to HackED Beta or are ready for another one, you should register now while tickets last!

Hackathons are for designing, creating, and building awesome projects. HackED is the premiere, annual, 24-hour hackathon from the Computer Engineering Club of the University of Alberta.

This event is for hackers who choose to learn because they can, and build because they love it. Weâ€™re about working together and applying yourself, your skills and your creativity.

Join us over the weekend of January 19 to hack your way to something new. Bring on the challenge, bring your ideas to life
