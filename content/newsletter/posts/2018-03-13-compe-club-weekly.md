### 5. Building Diverse Workplace Cultures: Engineering and STEM at UBC - A Case Study
**When:** March 19, 3:00-4:30 pm
**Where:** 1-182 Edmonton Clinic Health Academy (ECHA)
Talk by: Dr. Elizabeth Croft

"If leadership is not intentional about cultural change, nothing will happen."

Dr. Croft is a world renowned expert in human robotics interaction. In addition, she has been instrumental in advancing gender equity in Engineering and the STEM field. As the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Chair for Women in Science and Engineering, she focused on strategies to improve women’s participation in STEM. As NSERC Chair, Dr. Croft led Westcoast Women in Engineering, Science and Technology (WWEST). Their mission is to promote STEM as an excellent career choice for women and other under-represented groups, and to identify and eliminate barriers that these groups face in their career paths.

Dr. Croft was also the lead investigator in a three-year SSHRC funded interdisciplinary research project “Engendering Engineering Success” to provide evidence-based information on the retention of women in engineering by focusing on workplace cultures that place women at a disadvantage. University of Alberta's Dr. Michelle Inness was amongst the co-PIs and University of Alberta's Dr. Lianne Lefsrud was a collaborator in EES.

Join us to explore how we can promote a culture change in our institutions.
