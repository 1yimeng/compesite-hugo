In this introductory session, the data science team at Cybera will provide you with an overview into data science, talk about how you can apply it in your area of expertise, share resources that you can leverage, and discuss what you may need to start your own data science project. We’ll also share success stories from Alberta organizations currently using data science and provide "real world" examples of how this practice can be applied.
