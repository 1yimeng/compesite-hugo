Since our club officially represents Computer Engineering students to the faculty, any current Computer Engineering student is automatically a member of the club and is able to vote in our elections. Non club members cannot vote in our elections.

For a member to become an executive, they must run for an executive position in one of our Annual General Mettings (AGM). Junior executives are elected during Fall AGM which typically happens in September or October. By elections for senior executives can also occur in the Fall AGM. Senior executives are elected during the Winter AGM which typically occurs in March. Keep an eye on our newsletter and/or Facebook page for announcements. Contact <internal@compeclub.com> for any further questions.

According to our club's constitution, only club members who have held a senior executive position can run for president. But, any member can run for a senior executive position without first holding a junior executive position.

Members can run for an executive position for fall semester, winter semester, or for both. So don't let co-op prevent you from running for an exec position! You can attend an AGM remotely in order to run for a position.
