We are the University of Alberta Computer Engineering Club! We are a student organization that represents the interest of Computer Engineers to other student organizations (such as ESS) as well as the Faculty of Engineering. We also host many events for the benefits of other students such as hackathons, career development sessions, board game nights, and more! 

Our group is a fantastic way to network with other engineering students and to hang out with some terrific and terrifying people. We have many [executives](/team) and contributing members across different years in our group.

Have any questions about our club? Visit our [FAQ page]({{< ref "faq/index.md" >}}).
