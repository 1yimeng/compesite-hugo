[HackED Beta](https://hackedbeta.compeclub.com/) is a 24 hour competition where students complete either a software and/or hardware project. Participants exercise their creativity by finding solutions for problems they want to work towards. This event is designed for beginner hackers!

We provide three meals and a ton of snacks to power them through their hack. Tons of new prizes will be given out, be it for winning the hackathon, winning an API prize, or winning a round of lightning trivia.
