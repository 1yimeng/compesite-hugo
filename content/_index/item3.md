CompE Week is a full week of career development workshops! Take your resume to the next level and land that dream interview! Learn to leverage LinkedIn, GitHub, and social media to increase your personal brand. Engage in mock technical and behavioural interviews in a low-risk environment. Finally, question a panel of CompE alumni and industry professionals about career development. After the panel is over, relax and network with members of the panel as well as your fellow students!

Some events and workshops are co-hosted by the [Engineering Employment Centre](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/student-services/employment?utm_source=redir&utm_medium=redir&utm_campaign=redir&utm_content=redir-www.employment.engineering.ualberta.ca).
